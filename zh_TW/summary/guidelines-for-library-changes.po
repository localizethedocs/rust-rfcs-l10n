"important people to get involved in the RFC process, it is important that we "

"necessary. That said, if you anticipate controversy, you might want to short-"
"circuit straight to an RFC. For instance new APIs almost certainly merit an "
"RFC. Especially as `std` has become more conservative in favour of the much "
"more agile cargoverse."
