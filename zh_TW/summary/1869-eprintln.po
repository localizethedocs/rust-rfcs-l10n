"This proposal will improve the ergonomics of the Rust language for "
"development of command-line tools and \"back end\" / \"computational "
"kernel\" programs.  Such programs need to maintain a distinction between "
"their _primary output_, which will be fed to the next element in a "
"computational \"pipeline\", and their _status reports_, which should go "
"directly to the user.  Conventionally, standard output should receive the "
"primary output and standard error should receive status reports."

"`eprintln!`.  All of the existing examples and tutorials should be checked "
"over for cases where `println!` is being used for a status report, and all "
"such cases should be changed to use `eprintln!` instead; similarly for "
"`print!`."

msgid ""
"The usual drawbacks of adding macros to the prelude apply.  In this case, I "
"think the most significant concern is to choose names that are unlikely to "
"conflict with existing library crates' _exported_ macros.  (Conversely, "
"_internal_ macros with the same names and semantics demonstrate that the "
"names chosen are appropriate.)"

#: src/1869-eprintln.md:82
msgid ""
"The names `eprintln!` and `eprint!` are terse, differing only in a single "
"letter from `println!` and `print!`, and it's not obvious at a glance what "
"the leading `e` means.  (\"This is too cryptic\" is the single most "
"frequently heard complaint from people who don't like `eprintln!`.)  "
"However, once you do know what it means it is reasonably memorable, and "
"anyone who is already familiar with stdout versus stderr is very likely to "
"guess correctly what it means."

"There is an increased teaching burden---but that's the wrong way to look at "
"it.  The Book and the reference manual _should have_ been teaching the "
"difference between \"primary output\" and \"status reports\" all along.  "
"This is something programmers already need to know in order to write "
"programs that fit well into the larger ecosystem.  Any documentation that "
"might be a new programmer's first exposure to the concept of \"standard "
"output\" has a duty to explain that there is also \"standard error\", and "
"when you should use which."

"We could provide only `eprintln!`, omitting the no-newline variant. Most "
"_error_ messages should be one or more complete lines, so it's not obvious "

"`println_err!`, `printlnerr!`, `errprintln!`, and several other variants on "

"People do live with `fprintf(stderr, ...)` in C, but on the other hand there "
