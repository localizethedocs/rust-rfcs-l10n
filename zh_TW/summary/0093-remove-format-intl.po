"Remove localization features from format!, and change the set of escapes "

"removed, `#` would no longer need to be escaped, and `{{`/`}}` would become "

"Localization is difficult to implement correctly, and doing so will likely "
"not be done in the standard library, but rather in an external library. "
"After talking with others much more familiar with localization, it has come "
"to light that our ad-hoc \"localization support\" in our format strings are "
"woefully inadequate for most real use cases of support for localization."

"The primary localization features that `format!` supports today are the "
"`plural` and `select` methods inside of format strings. These methods are "
"choices made at format-time based on the input arguments of how to format a "
"string. This functionality would be removed from the compiler entirely."

"Upon landing, there was a significant amount of discussion about the escape "
"sequence that would be used in format strings. Some context can be found on "
"some [old pull requests](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9161), and the "
"current escape mechanism has been the source of [much confusion](https://"
"github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/12814). With the removal of localization "
"methods, and namely nested format directives, it is possible to reconsider "
"the choices of escaping again."

"The only two characters that need escaping in format strings are `{` and `}"
"`. One of the more appealing syntaxes for escaping was to double the "
"character to represent the character itself. This would mean that `{{` is an "
"escape for a `{` character, while `}}` would be an escape for a `}` "
"character."

"Adopting this scheme would avoid clashing with Rust's string literal "

"The localization methods of select/plural are genuinely used for "
"applications that do not involve localization. For example, the compiler and "
"rustdoc often use plural to easily create plural messages. Removing this "
"functionality from format strings would impose a burden of likely "
"dynamically allocating a string at runtime or defining two separate format "
"strings."

"Additionally, changing the syntax of format strings is quite an invasive "
"change. Raw string literals serve as a good use case for format strings that "
"must escape the `{` and `}` characters. The current system is arguably good "
"enough to pass with for today."

"The major localization approach explored has been l20n, which has shown "
"itself to be fairly incompatible with the way format strings work today. "
"Different localization systems, however, have not been explored. Systems "
"such as gettext would be able to leverage format strings quite well, but it "
"was claimed that gettext for localization is inadequate for modern use-cases."

"It is also an unexplored possibility whether the current format string "
"syntax could be leveraged by l20n. It is unlikely that time will be "
"allocated to polish off an localization library before 1.0, and it is "
"currently seen as undesirable to have a half-baked system in the libraries "
"rather than a first-class well designed system."
