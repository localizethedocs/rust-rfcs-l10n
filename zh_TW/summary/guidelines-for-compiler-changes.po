"Compiler RFCs will be managed by the compiler sub-team, and tagged `T-"
"compiler`. The compiler sub-team will do an initial triage of new PRs within "
"a week of submission. The result of triage will either be that the PR is "
"assigned to a member of the sub-team for shepherding, the PR is closed "
"because the sub-team believe it should be done without an RFC, or closed "
"because the sub-team feel it should clearly not be done and further "
"discussion is not necessary. We'll follow the standard procedure for "
"shepherding, final comment period, etc."
