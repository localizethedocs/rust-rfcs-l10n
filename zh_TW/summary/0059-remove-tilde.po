"The tilde (`~`) operator and type construction do not support allocators and "
"therefore should be removed in favor of the `box` keyword and a language "
"item for the type."

msgid ""
"There will be a unique pointer type in the standard library, `Box<T,A>` "
"where `A` is an allocator. The `~T` type syntax does not allow for custom "
"allocators. Therefore, in order to keep `~T` around while still supporting "
"allocators, we would need to make it an alias for `Box<T,Heap>`. In the "
"spirit of having one way to do things, it seems better to remove `~` "
"entirely as a type notation."

"`~EXPR` and `box EXPR` are duplicate functionality; the former does not "
"support allocators. Again in the spirit of having one and only one way to do "
"things, I would like to remove `~EXPR`."
