"In today's stable Rust it's not possible to catch a panic on the thread that "

"required for correctness or necessary for building a useful abstraction:"

msgid ""
"It is currently defined as undefined behavior to have a Rust program panic "
"across an FFI boundary. For example if C calls into Rust and Rust panics, "
"then this is undefined behavior. Being able to catch a panic will allow "
"writing C APIs in Rust that do not risk aborting the process they are "
"embedded into."
msgstr ""

"Stabilizing the `catch_panic` function would enable these two use cases, but "
"let's also take a look at the current signature of the function:"
msgstr ""

#: src/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md:34
msgid ""
"This function will run the closure `f` and if it panics return "
"`Err(Box<Any>)`. If the closure doesn't panic it will return `Ok(val)` where "
"`val` is the returned value of the closure. The closure, however, is "
"restricted to only close over `Send` and `'static` data. These bounds can be "
"overly restrictive, and due to thread-local storage [they can be subverted]"
"(https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25662), making it unclear what "
"purpose they serve. This RFC proposes to remove the bounds as well."

"Historically Rust has purposefully avoided the foray into the situation of "
"catching panics, largely because of a problem typically referred to as "
"\"exception safety\". To further understand the motivation of stabilization "
"and relaxing the bounds, let's review what exception safety is and what it "
"means for Rust."

"Languages with exceptions have the property that a function can \"return\" "
"early if an exception is thrown. While exceptions aren't too hard to reason "
"about when thrown explicitly, they can be problematic when they are thrown "
"by code being called -- especially when that code isn't known in advance. "

#: src/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md:65
msgid ""
"Exceptional control flow often exacerbates this first component of breaking "
"invariants. For example many data structures have a number of invariants "
"that are dynamically upheld for correctness, and the type's routines can "
"temporarily break these invariants to be fixed up before the function "
"returns.  If, however, an exception is thrown in this interim period the "
"broken invariant could be accidentally exposed."
msgstr ""

#: src/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md:72
msgid ""
"The second component, observing a broken invariant, can sometimes be "
"difficult in the face of exceptions, but languages often have constructs to "
"enable these sorts of witnesses. Two primary methods of doing so are "
"something akin to finally blocks (code run on a normal or exceptional "
"return) or just catching the exception. In both cases code which later runs "
"that has access to the original data structure will see the broken "
"invariants."

"Now that we've got a better understanding of how an exception might cause a "

"While this code may look correct, it's actually not memory safe. `Vec` has "
"an internal invariant that its first `len` elements are safe to drop at any "

"to `set_len` (the next 10 elements are uninitialized). If the type `T`'s "
"`clone` method panics then this broken invariant will escape the function. "

"One alternative, which is somewhat more of an addition, is to have the "
"standard library entirely abandon all exception safety mitigation tactics. "
"As explained in the motivation section, exception safety will not lead to "
"memory unsafety unless paired with unsafe code, so it is perhaps within the "
"realm of possibility to remove the tactics of poisoning from mutexes and "
"simply require that consumers deal with exception safety 100% of the time."

"This alternative is often motivated by saying that there are enough methods "
"to subvert the default mitigation tactics that it's not worth trying to plug "
"some holes and not others. Upon closer inspection, however, the areas where "
"safe code needs to worry about exception safety are isolated to the single-"
"threaded situations. For example `RefCell`, destructors, and `catch_panic` "
"all only expose data possibly broken through a panic in a single thread."

"Once a thread boundary is crossed, the only current way to share data "
"mutably is via `Mutex` or `RwLock`, both of which are poisoned by default. "
"This sort of sharing is fundamental to threaded code, and poisoning by "
"default allows safe code to freely use many threads without having to "
"consider exception safety across threads (as poisoned data will tear down "
"all connected threads)."

"This property of multithreaded programming in Rust is seen as strong enough "
"that poisoning should not be removed by default, and in fact a new "
"hypothetical `thread::scoped` API (a rough counterpart of `catch_panic`) "
"could also propagate panics by default (like poisoning) with an ability to "
"opt out (like `PoisonError`)."
