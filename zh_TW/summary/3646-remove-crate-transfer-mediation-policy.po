"As the number of crates on crates.io grows, so do the number of effectively "

"to attempt to contact a crate owner to see if they would be willing to "
"transfer their crate. Managing these requests take time, and they aren't "
"even usually successful. The crates.io team would like to spend their time "
"working on the site rather than providing this crate mediation service."

"Some crate transfers that would have happened with the help of the crates.io "

"is significant enough to justify the time spent by the crates.io team."

"Alternatively, crates.io could build a mechanism into crates.io to allow one "
