"`SliceExt::get` and `SliceExt::get_mut` can be thought as non-panicking "
"versions of the simple indexing syntax, `a[idx]`, and `SliceExt::"
"get_unchecked` and `SliceExt::get_unchecked_mut` can be thought of as unsafe "
"versions with bounds checks elided. However, there is no such equivalent for "
"`a[start..end]`, `a[start..]`, or `a[..end]`. This RFC proposes such methods "
"to fill the gap."

"The `get`, `get_mut`, `get_unchecked`, and `get_unchecked_mut` will be made "
"generic over `usize` as well as ranges of `usize` like slice's `Index` "
"implementation currently is. This will allow e.g. `a.get(start..end)` which "
"will behave analagously to `a[start..end]`."

"Because methods cannot be overloaded in an ad-hoc manner in the same way "
"that traits may be implemented, we introduce a `SliceIndex` trait which is "
"implemented by types which can index into a slice:"

"The `SliceIndex` trait is unfortunate - it's tuned for exactly the set of "
"methods it's used by. It only exists because inherent methods cannot be "
"overloaded the same way that trait implementations can be. It would most "
"likely remain unstable indefinitely."

"Documentation may suffer. Rustdoc output currently explicitly shows each of "
"the ways you can index a slice, while there will simply be a single generic "
"implementation with this change. This may not be that bad, though. The doc "
"block currently seems to provided the most valuable information to newcomers "
"rather than the trait bound, and that will still be present with this change."

"A previous version of this RFC introduced new `get_slice` etc methods rather "

"Instead of one trait amalgamating all of the required methods, we could have "
"one trait per method. This would open a more reasonable door to stabilizing "
"those traits, but adds quite a lot more surface area. Replacing an unstable "
"`SliceIndex` trait with a collection would be backwards compatible."
