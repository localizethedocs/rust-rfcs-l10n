msgstr ""

#: src/1300-intrinsic-semantics.md:13
msgid ""
"Intrinsics are currently poorly-specified in terms of how they function. "
"This means they are a cause of ICEs and general confusion. The poor "
"specification of them also means discussion affecting intrinsics gets mired "
"in opinions about what intrinsics should be like and how they should act or "
"be implemented."

msgid ""
"Intrinsics are currently implemented by generating the code for the "
"intrinsic at the call site. This allows for intrinsics to be implemented "
"much more efficiently in many cases. For example, `transmute` is able to "
"evaluate the input expression directly into the storage for the result, "
"removing a potential copy. This is the main idea of intrinsics, a way to "
"generate code that is otherwise inexpressible in Rust."

#: src/1300-intrinsic-semantics.md:26
msgid ""
"Keeping this in-place behaviour is desirable, so this RFC proposes that "
"intrinsics should only be usable as functions when called. This is not a "
"change from the current behaviour, as you already cannot use intrinsics as "
"function pointers. Using an intrinsic in any way other than directly calling "
"should be considered an error."
msgstr ""

#: src/1300-intrinsic-semantics.md:31
msgid ""
"Intrinsics should continue to be defined and declared the same way. The "
"`rust-intrinsic` and `platform-intrinsic` ABIs indicate that the function is "
"an intrinsic function."

"Allow coercion to regular functions and generate wrappers. This is similar "
"to how we handle named tuple constructors. Doing this undermines the idea of "
"intrinsics as a way of getting the compiler to generate specific code at the "
"call-site however."
