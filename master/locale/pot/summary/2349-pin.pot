msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:15
msgid ""
"A longstanding problem for Rust has been dealing with types that should not "
"be moved. A common motivation for this is when a struct contains a pointer "
"into its own representation - moving that struct would invalidate that "
"pointer. This use case has become especially important recently with work on "
"generators. Because generators essentially reify a stackframe into an object "
"that can be manipulated in code, it is likely for idiomatic usage of a "
"generator to result in such a self-referential type, if it is allowed."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:23
msgid ""
"This proposal adds an API to std which would allow you to guarantee that a "
"particular value will never move again, enabling safe APIs that rely on self-"
"references to exist."

msgid ""
"The core goal of this RFC is to **provide a reference type where the "
"referent is guaranteed to never move before being dropped**. We want to do "
"this with a minimum disruption to the type system, and in fact, this RFC "
"shows that we can achieve the goal without _any_ type system changes."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:31
msgid ""
"Let's take that goal apart, piece by piece, from the perspective of the "
"futures (i.e. async/await) use case:"
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:33
msgid ""
"**Reference type**. The reason we need a reference type is that, when "
"working with things like futures, we generally want to combine smaller "
"futures into larger ones, and only at the top level put an entire resulting "
"future into some immovable location. Thus, we need a reference type for "
"methods like `poll`, so that we can break apart a large future into its "
"smaller components, while retaining the guarantee about immobility."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:35
msgid ""
"**Never to move before being dropped**. Again looking at the futures case, "
"once we begin `poll`ing a future, we want it to be able to store references "
"into itself, which is possible if we can guarantee that the whole future "
"will never move. We don't try to track _whether_ such references exist at "
"the type level, since that would involve cumbersome typestate; instead, we "
"simply decree that by the time you initially `poll`, you promise to never "
"move an immobile future again."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:37
msgid ""
"At the same time, we want to support futures (and iterators, etc.) that "
"_can_ move. While it's possible to do so by providing two distinct `Future` "
"(or `Iterator`, etc) traits, such designs incur unacceptable ergonomic costs."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:39
msgid ""
"The key insight of this RFC is that we can create a new library type, "
"`Pin<'a, T>`, which encompasses _both_ movable and immobile referents. The "
"type is paired with a new auto trait, `Unpin`, which determines the meaning "
"of `Pin<'a, T>`:"
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:41
msgid ""
"If `T: Unpin` (which is the default), then `Pin<'a, T>` is entirely "
"equivalent to `&'a mut T`."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:42
msgid ""
"If `T: !Unpin`, then `Pin<'a, T>` provides a unique reference to a `T` with "
"lifetime `'a`, but only provides `&'a T` access safely. It also guarantees "
"that the referent will _never_ be moved. However, getting `&'a mut T` access "
"is unsafe, because operations like `mem::replace` mean that `&mut` access is "
"enough to move data out of the referent; you must promise not to do so."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:44
msgid ""
"To be clear: the _sole_ function of `Unpin` is to control the meaning of "
"`Pin`. Making `Unpin` an auto trait means that the vast majority of types "
"are automatically \"movable\", so `Pin` degenerates to `&mut`. In the case "
"that you need immobility, you _opt out_ of `Unpin`, and then `Pin` becomes "
"meaningful for your type."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:46
msgid ""
"Putting this all together, we arrive at the following definition of `Future`:"
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:57
msgid ""
"By default when implementing `Future` for a struct, this definition is "
"equivalent to today's, which takes `&mut self`. But if you want to allow "

"takes care of the rest."
msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:59
msgid ""
"This RFC also provides a pinned analogy to `Box` called `PinBox<T>`. It "
"works along the same lines as the `Pin` type discussed here - if the type "
"implements `Unpin`, it functions the same as the unpinned `Box`; if the type "
"has opted out of `Unpin`, it guarantees that they type behind the reference "
"will not be moved again."

"In a previous iteration of this RFC, there was a wrapper type called "

msgstr ""

#: src/2349-pin.md:326

"The primary benefit of this approach was that it was partially integrated "

#: src/2349-pin.md:333

"And the only types that implemented all of the necessary traits to be put "
