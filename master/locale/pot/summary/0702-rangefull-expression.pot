msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0702-rangefull-expression.md:11
msgid ""
"Range expressions `a..b`, `a..` and `..b` all have dedicated syntax and "
"produce first-class values. This means that they will be usable and useful "
"in custom APIs, so for consistency, the fourth slicing range, `RangeFull`, "
"could have its own syntax `..`"

"`..` will produce a `std::ops::RangeFull` value when it is used in an "
"expression. This means that slicing the whole range of a sliceable container "
"is written `&foo[..]`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0702-rangefull-expression.md:22
msgid ""
"We should remove the old `&foo[]` syntax for consistency. Because of this "
"breaking change, it would be best to change this before Rust 1.0."

"As previously stated, when we have range expressions in the language, they "
"become convenient to use when stating ranges in an API."

"@Gankro fielded ideas where methods like for example `.remove(index) -> "
"element` on a collection could be generalized by accepting either indices or "
"ranges. Today's `.drain()` could be expressed as `.remove(..)`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0702-rangefull-expression.md:33
msgid ""
"Matrix or multidimensional array APIs can use the range expressions for "
"indexing and/or generalized slicing and `..` represents selecting a full "
"axis in a multidimensional slice, i.e. `(1..3, ..)` slices the first axis "
"and preserves the second."
msgstr ""

#: src/0702-rangefull-expression.md:38
msgid ""
"Because of deref coercions, the very common conversions of String or Vec to "
"slices don't need to use slicing syntax at all, so the change in verbosity "
"from `[]` to `[..]` is not a concern."

"`..` already appears in patterns, as in this example: `if let Some(..) = foo "
"{ }`. This is not a conflict per se, but the same syntax element is used in "
"two different ways in Rust."
