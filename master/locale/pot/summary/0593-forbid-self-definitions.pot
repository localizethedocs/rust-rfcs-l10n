#: src/0593-forbid-Self-definitions.md:11
msgid ""
"Right now, `Self` is just a regular identifier that happens to get a special "
"meaning inside trait definitions and impls. Specifically, users are not "
"forbidden from defining a type called `Self`, which can lead to weird "
"situations:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0593-forbid-Self-definitions.md:25
msgid ""
"This piece of code defines types called `Self` and `Foo`, and a method "
"`foo()` that because of the special meaning of `Self` has the signature "
"`fn(&Foo, Foo)`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0593-forbid-Self-definitions.md:29
msgid ""
"So in this case it is not possible to define a method on `Foo` that takes "
"the actual type `Self` without renaming it or creating a renamed alias."
msgstr ""

#: src/0593-forbid-Self-definitions.md:32
msgid ""
"It would also be highly unidiomatic to actually name the type `Self` for a "
"custom type, precisely because of this ambiguity, so preventing it outright "
"seems like the right thing to do."
msgstr ""

#: src/0593-forbid-Self-definitions.md:35
msgid ""
"Making the identifier `Self` an keyword would prevent this situation because "
"the user could not use it freely for custom definitions."
