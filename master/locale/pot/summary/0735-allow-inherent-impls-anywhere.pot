msgstr ""

#: src/0735-allow-inherent-impls-anywhere.md:12
msgid ""
"The main motivation for disallowing such `impl` bodies was the "
"implementation detail of fake modules being created to allow resolving "
"`Type::method`, which only worked correctly for `impl Type {...}` if a "
"`struct Type` or `enum Type` were defined in the same module. The old "
"mechanism was obsoleted by UFCS, which desugars `Type::method` to `<Type>::"
"method` and performs a type-based method lookup instead, with path "
"resolution having no knowledge of inherent `impl`s - and all of that was "
"implemented by [rust-lang/rust#22172](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"
"pull/22172)."

"Aside from invalidating the previous RFC's motivation, there is something to "
"be said about dealing with restricted inherent `impl`s: it leads to non-DRY "
"single use extension traits, the worst offender being `AstBuilder` in "
"libsyntax, with almost 300 lines of redundant method definitions."

"Remove the existing limitation, and only require that the `Self` type of the "
"`impl` is defined in the same crate. This allows moving methods to other "
"modules:"

msgid "Drawbacks"
msgstr ""

#: src/0735-allow-inherent-impls-anywhere.md:42
msgid ""
"Consistency and ease of finding method definitions by looking at the module "
"the type is defined in, has been mentioned as an advantage of this "
"limitation. However, trait `impl`s already have that problem and single use "
"extension traits could arguably be worse."

"Leave it as it is. Seems unsatisfactory given that we're no longer limited "
"by implementation details."

"We could go further and allow adding inherent methods to any type that could "
"implement a trait outside the crate:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0735-allow-inherent-impls-anywhere.md:61
msgid ""
"The implementation would reuse the same coherence rules as for trait "
"`impl`s, and, for looking up methods, the \"type definition to impl\" map "
"would be replaced with a map from method name to a set of `impl`s containing "
"that method."

"_Technically_, I am not aware of any formulation that limits inherent "
"methods to user-defined types in the same crate, and this extra support "
"could turn out to have a straight-forward implementation with no "
"complications, but I'm trying to present the whole situation to avoid issues "
"in the future - even though I'm not aware of backwards compatibility ones or "
"any related to compiler internals."
