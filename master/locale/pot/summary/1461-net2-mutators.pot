msgid ""
"[RFC 1158](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1158) proposed the "
"addition of more functionality for the `TcpStream`, `TcpListener` and "
"`UdpSocket` types, but was declined so that those APIs could be built up out "
"of tree in the [net2 crate](https://crates.io/crates/net2/). This RFC "
"proposes pulling portions of net2's APIs into the standard library."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/1461-net2-mutators.md:18
msgid ""
"The functionality provided by the standard library's wrappers around "
"standard networking types is fairly limited, and there is a large set of "
"well supported, standard functionality that is not currently implemented in "
"`std::net` but has existed in net2 for some time."

"This does not cover the entirety of net2's APIs. In particular, this RFC "
"does not propose to touch the builder types."

"The traditional approach would be to add these as unstable, inherent "
"methods. However, since inherent methods take precedence over trait methods, "
"this would cause all code using the extension traits in net2 to start "
"reporting stability errors. Instead, we have two options:"
msgstr ""

#: src/1461-net2-mutators.md:101
msgid ""
"Add this functionality as _stable_ inherent methods. The rationale here "
"would be that time in a nursery crate acts as a de facto stabilization "
"period."
msgstr ""

#: src/1461-net2-mutators.md:103
msgid ""
"Add this functionality via _unstable_ extension traits. When/if we decide to "
"stabilize, we would deprecate the trait and add stable inherent methods. "
"Extension traits are a bit more annoying to work with, but this would give "
"us a formal stabilization period."

"Option 2 seems like the safer approach unless people feel comfortable with "
