msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/1660-try-borrow.md:14
msgid ""
"Whenever something is built from user input, for example a graph in which "
"nodes are `RefCell<T>` values, it is primordial to avoid panicking on bad "
"input. The only way to avoid panics on cyclic input in this case is a way to "
"conditionally-borrow the cell contents."
