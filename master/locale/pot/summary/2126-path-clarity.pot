"The fact that adding a `use futures;` statement to the submodule makes the "

#: src/2126-path-clarity.md:155
msgid ""
"**Is a `use` path talking about this crate or an external one?** When "

"in your head a list of external crates and/or top-level modules for the "
"current crate. It has long been idiomatic to visually group imports from the "
"current crate separately from external imports. In general, this suggests a "
"certain muddiness around the root namespace."
msgstr ""

#: src/2126-path-clarity.md:162
msgid ""
"**Is an item marked `pub` _actually_ public?** It's a fairly common idiom "
"today to have a private module that contains `pub` items used by its parent "
"and siblings only. This idiom arises in part because of ergonomic concerns; "
"writing `pub(super)` or `pub(crate)` on these internal items feels heavier. "
"But the consequence is that, when reading code, visibility annotations tell "

msgid ""
"From a learnability perspective, the fact that the paths in the module "

"another small speedbump, and in particular makes `mod foo;` declarations "

msgstr ""

#: src/2126-path-clarity.md:182
