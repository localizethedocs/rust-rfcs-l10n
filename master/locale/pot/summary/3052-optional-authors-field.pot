msgstr ""

#: src/3052-optional-authors-field.md:11
msgid ""
"This RFC proposes to make the `package.authors` field of `Cargo.toml` "
"optional. This RFC also proposes preventing Cargo from auto-filling it, "
"allowing crates to be published to crates.io without the field being "
"present, and avoiding displaying its contents on the crates.io and docs.rs "
"UI."
msgstr ""

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/3052-optional-authors-field.md:19
msgid ""
"The crates.io registry does not allow users to change the contents of "
"already published versions: this is highly desirable to ensure working "
"builds don't break in the future, but it also has the unfortunate side-"
"effect of preventing people from updating the list of crate authors defined "
"in `Cargo.toml`'s `package.authors` field."
msgstr ""

#: src/3052-optional-authors-field.md:25
msgid ""
"This is especially problematic when people change their name or want to "
"remove their name from the Internet, and the crates.io team doesn't have any "
"way to address that at the moment except for deleting the affected crates or "
"versions altogether. We don't do that lightly, but there were a few cases "
"where we were forced to do so."
msgstr ""

#: src/3052-optional-authors-field.md:31
msgid ""
"The contents of the field also tend to scale poorly as the size of a project "
"grows, with projects either making the field useless by just stating \"The "
"$PROJECT developers\" or only naming the original authors without mentioning "
"other major contributors."

"crates.io will allow publishing crates without the `package.authors` field, "

"`cargo init` will stop pre-populating the field when running the command, "
