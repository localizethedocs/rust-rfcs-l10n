"This feature would greatly simplify some logic where we must match a pattern "

"recompute in the match arm."

"This proposal would introduce syntax for a match arm: `pat if let guard_pat "
"= guard_expr => body_expr` with semantics so the arm is chosen iff the "
"argument of `match` matches `pat` and `guard_expr` matches `guard_pat`. The "
"variables of `pat` are bound in `guard_expr`, and the variables of `pat` and "
"`guard_pat` are bound in `body_expr`. The syntax is otherwise the same as "
