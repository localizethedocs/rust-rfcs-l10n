msgstr ""

#: src/2965-project-error-handling.md:14
msgid ""
"The error handling project group aims to reduce confusion on how to "
"structure error handling for users in the Rust community. This will be "
"accomplished by creating learning resources and pushing effort to upstream "
"widely used crates into the standard library. As a secondary goal, this "
"project group will also try to resolve some known issues with the `Error` "
"trait and reporting errors in panics/termination."
