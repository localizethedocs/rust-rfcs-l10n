msgid ""
"This RFC proposes to allow access to enum variants through type aliases. "
"This enables better abstraction/information hiding by encapsulating enums in "
"aliases without having to create another enum type and requiring the "
"conversion from and into the \"alias\" enum."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2338-type-alias-enum-variants.md:17
msgid ""
"While type aliases provide a useful means of encapsulating a type definition "
"in order to hide implementation details or provide a more ergonomic API, the "
"substitution principle currently falls down in the face of enum variants. "
"It's reasonable to expect that a type alias can fully replace the original "
"type specification, and so the lack of working support for aliased enum "
"variants represents an ergonomic gap in the language/type system. This can "
"be useful in exposing an interface from a dependency to library users while "
"\"hiding\" the exact implementation details. There's at least some evidence "
"that people have asked about this capability before."

msgid ""
"In general, the simple explanation here is that type aliases can be used in "
"more places where you currently have to go through the original type "
"definition, as it relates to enum variants. As much as possible, enum "
"variants should work as if the original type was specified rather than the "
"alias. This should make type aliases easier to learn than before, because "
"there are fewer exceptions to their applicability."

"Require the user to implement wrapper `enum`s instead of using aliases. This "

"Renaming of types via `use` statements. This provides a good solution in the "
