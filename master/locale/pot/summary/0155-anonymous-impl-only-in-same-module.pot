msgid ""
"Before I can explain the motivation for this, I should provide some "
"background as to how anonymous traits are implemented, and the sorts of bugs "
"we see with the current behaviour. The conclusion will be that we "
"effectively already only support `impl MyStruct` in the same module that "
"`MyStruct` is defined, and making this a rule will simply give cleaner error "
"messages."

"The compiler first sees `impl MyStruct` during the resolve phase, "
"specifically in `Resolver::build_reduced_graph()`, called by `Resolver::"
"resolve()` in `src/librustc/middle/resolve.rs`. This is before any type "
"checking (or type resolution, for that matter) is done, so the compiler "
"trusts for now that `MyStruct` is a valid type."

"If `MyStruct` is a path with more than one segment, such as `mymod::"
"MyStruct`, it is silently ignored (how was this not flagged when the code "
"was written??), which effectively causes static methods in such `impl`s to "
"be dropped on the floor. A silver lining here is that nothing is added to "
"the current module namespace, so the shadowing bugs demonstrated in the next "
"bullet point do not apply here. (To locate this bug in the code, find the "
"`match` immediately following the `FIXME (#3785)` comment in `resolve.rs`.) "
"This leads to the following"

"If one does not exist, the compiler creates a submodule `MyStruct` of the "

"this module. If such a module already exists, the methods are appended to "
"it, to support multiple `impl MyStruct` blocks within the same module. If a "

"Notice at this point that if there is a `use MyStruct`, the compiler will "
"act as though it is unaware of this. This is because imports are not "
"resolved yet (they are in `Resolver::resolve_imports()` called immediately "
"after `Resolver::build_reduced_graph()` is called). In the final resolution "
"step, `MyStruct` will be searched in the namespace of the current module, "
"checking imports only as a fallback (and only in some contexts), so the `use "
"MyStruct` is effectively shadowed. If there is an `impl MyStruct` in the "
"file being imported from, the user expects that the new `impl MyStruct` will "
"append to that one, same as if they are in the original file. This leads to "

"which @Ryman noticed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15060 . The "
"reason for this is that in `Resolver::resolve_crate()`, the final step of "
"`Resolver::resolve()`, the type of an anonymous `impl` is determined by "
"`NameBindings::def_for_namespace(TypeNS)`. This function searches the "
"namespace `TypeNS` (which is <i>not</i> affected by imports) for a type; "
"failing that it tries for a module; failing that it returns `None`. The "
"result is that when typeck runs, it sees `impl [module name]` instead of "
"`impl [type name]`."
