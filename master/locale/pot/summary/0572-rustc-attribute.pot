msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0572-rustc-attribute.md:11
msgid ""
"Interpreting the current backwards compatibility rules strictly, it's not "
"possible to add any further language features that use new attributes. For "
"example, if we wish to add a feature that expands the attribute "
"`#[awesome_deriving(Encodable)]` into an implementation of `Encodable`, any "
"existing code that contains uses of the `#[awesome_deriving]` attribute "
"might be broken. While such attributes are useless in release 1.0 code "
"(since syntax extensions aren't allowed yet), we still have a case of code "
"that stops compiling after an update of a release build."

msgid "Detailed design"
msgstr ""

#: src/0572-rustc-attribute.md:20
msgid ""
"We add a feature gate, `custom_attribute`, that disallows the use of any "
"attributes not defined by the compiler or consumed in any other way."
msgstr ""

#: src/0572-rustc-attribute.md:22
msgid ""
"This is achieved by elevating the `unused_attribute` lint to a feature gate "
"check (with the gate open, it reverts to being a lint). We'd also need to "
"ensure that it runs after all the other lints (currently it runs as part of "
"the main lint check and might warn about attributes which are actually "
"consumed by other lints later on)."
msgstr ""

#: src/0572-rustc-attribute.md:24
msgid ""
"Eventually, we can try for a namespacing system as described below, however "
"with unused attributes feature gated, we need not worry about it until we "
"start considering stabilizing plugins."

"I don't see much of a drawback (except that the alternatives below might be "
"more lucrative). This might make it harder for people who wish to use custom "
"attributes for static analysis in 1.0 code."

"This is less restrictive for the user, but it restricts us to a form of "
"namespacing for any future attributes which we may wish to introduce. This "
"is suboptimal, since by the time plugins stabilize (which is when user-"
"defined attributes become useful for release code) we may add many more "
"attributes to the compiler and they will all have cumbersome names."

"If we do nothing we can still manage to add new attributes, however we will "
"need to invent new syntax for it. This will probably be in the form of basic "
"namespacing support (`#[rustc::awesome_deriving]`) or arbitrary token tree "
"support (the use case will probably still end up looking something like "
"`#[rustc::awesome_deriving]`)"
