"In quite a few situations, one needs to check whether a sequence of elements "

"The lack of an `is_sorted()` function in Rust's standard library has led to "
"[countless programmers implementing their own](https://github.com/search?"

"to write a one-liner using iterators (e.g. `(0..arr.len() - 1).all(|i| "
