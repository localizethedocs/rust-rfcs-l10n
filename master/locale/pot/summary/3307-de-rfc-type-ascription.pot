"ascription.html), [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"
"issues/23416)) has been a merged RFC for seven years, with no clear path to "
"stabilization. Since then, syntactic norms in Rust have shifted "
"significantly and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that this RFC if "
"posted would have landed today. During this time the nightly support for "
"this feature has impacted the quality of parser diagnostics; creating a "
"large black hole of potential mistakes that lead to a suggestion around "
"ascription (a feature most cannot use) when there could have been a more "
"targeted and accurate diagnostic."

"One of the primary demotivations is the negative effect on diagnostics. `:` "
"is a pretty highly used syntactic component in Rust: a double colon is a "
"crucial part of how paths work, and paths are found _everywhere_ in Rust "
"(every variable and type name is a path). It's a rather easy to accidentally "
"type `:` instead of `::`, and that is often interpreted as type ascription "
"syntax. It's a terrible experience for the user to make an often hard-to-"
"notice mistake and get told they are trying to use a feature they may not "
"even have heard of. Here's [an example](https://twitter.com/ekuber/"
"status/1554868154630897666) of a bad diagnostic caused by type ascription; "
"while such diagnostics can be fixed, there are just so many of them. The "
"fact that this is _still_ a problem despite the amazing work being put into "
"diagnostics is a signal that it may always be a problem. And if this feature "
"were to stabilize as-is, it would likely get worse since there would be "
"backpressure to improve the diagnostics of legitimate uses of ascription. "
"Good diagnostics are an exercise in guessing user intent; and the harder we "
"make that the worse the diagnostics will be."
