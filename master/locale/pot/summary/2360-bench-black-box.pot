"This RFC adds `core::hint::bench_black_box` (see [black box](https://en."

"`bench_black_box` could do."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2360-bench-black-box.md:18
msgid ""
"Due to the constrained nature of synthetic benchmarks, the compiler is often "
"able to perform optimizations that wouldn't otherwise trigger in practice, "
"like completely removing a benchmark if it has no side-effects."
msgstr ""

#: src/2360-bench-black-box.md:22
msgid ""
"Currently, stable Rust users need to introduce expensive operations into "
"their programs to prevent these optimizations. Examples thereof are volatile "
"loads and stores, or calling unknown functions via C FFI. These operations "
"incur overheads that often would not be present in the application the "
"synthetic benchmark is trying to model."
