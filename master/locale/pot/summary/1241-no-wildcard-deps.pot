"A Cargo crate's dependencies are associated with constraints that specify "
"the set of versions of the dependency with which the crate is compatible. "
"These constraints range from accepting exactly one version (`=1.2.3`), to "
"accepting a range of versions (`^1.2.3`, `~1.2.3`, `>= 1.2.3, < 3.0.0`), to "
"accepting any version at all (`*`). This RFC proposes to update crates.io to "
"reject publishes of crates that have compile or build dependencies with a "
"wildcard version constraint."

msgstr ""

#: src/1241-no-wildcard-deps.md:18
msgid ""
"Version constraints are a delicate balancing act between stability and "
"flexibility. On one extreme, one can lock dependencies to an exact version. "
"From one perspective, this is great, since the dependencies a user will "
"consume will be the same that the developers tested against. However, on any "
"nontrival project, one will inevitably run into conflicts where library A "
"depends on version `1.2.3` of library B, but library C depends on version "
"`1.2.4`, at which point, the only option is to force the version of library "
"B to one of them and hope everything works."
msgstr ""

#: src/1241-no-wildcard-deps.md:27
msgid ""
"On the other hand, a wildcard (`*`) constraint will never conflict with "
"anything! There are other things to worry about here, though. A version "
"constraint is fundamentally an assertion from a library's author to its "
"users that the library will work with any version of a dependency that "
"matches its constraint. A wildcard constraint is claiming that the library "
"will work with any version of the dependency that has ever been released _or "
"will ever be released, forever_. This is a somewhat absurd guarantee to make "
"- forever is a long time!"

"Absurd guarantees on their own are not necessarily sufficient motivation to "

"As an example, consider the [openssl](https://crates.io/crates/openssl) "
"crate. It is one of the most popular libraries on crates.io, with several "
"hundred downloads every day. 50% of the [libraries that depend on it]"
"(https://crates.io/crates/openssl/reverse_dependencies) have a wildcard "
"constraint on the version. None of them can build against every version that "
"has ever been released. Indeed, no libraries can since many of those "
"releases can before Rust 1.0 released. In addition, almost all of them them "
"will fail to compile against version 0.7 of openssl when it is released. "
"When that happens, users of those libraries will be forced to manually "
"override Cargo's version selection every time it is recalculated. This is "
"not a fun time."

"Bad version restrictions are also \"viral\". Even if a developer is careful "
"to pick dependencies that have reasonable version restrictions, there could "
"be a wildcard constraint hiding five transitive levels down.  Manually "
"searching the entire dependency graph is an exercise in frustration that "
"shouldn't be necessary."

"On the other hand, consider a library that has a version constraint of "
"`^0.6`. When openssl 0.7 releases, the library will either continue to work "
"against version 0.7, or it won't. In the first case, the author can simply "
"extend the constraint to `>= 0.6, < 0.8` and consumers can use it with "
"version 0.6 or 0.7 without any trouble. If it does not work against version "
"0.7, consumers of the library are fine! Their code will continue to work "
"without any manual intervention. The author can update the library to work "
"with version 0.7 and release a new version with a constraint of `^0.7` to "
"support consumers that want to use that newer release."

"It's not totally clear how to precisely define \"reasonable\" constraints. "
