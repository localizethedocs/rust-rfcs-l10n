"Removes the \"virtual struct\" (aka struct inheritance) feature, which is "
"currently feature gated."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0341-remove-virtual-structs.md:12
msgid ""
"Virtual structs were added experimentally prior to the RFC process as a way "
"of inheriting fields from one struct when defining a new struct."
msgstr ""

#: src/0341-remove-virtual-structs.md:15
msgid "The feature was introduced and remains behind a feature gate."
msgstr ""

#: src/0341-remove-virtual-structs.md:17
msgid "The motivations for removing this feature altogether are:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0341-remove-virtual-structs.md:19
msgid ""
"The feature is likely to be replaced by a more general mechanism, as part of "
"the need to address hierarchies such as the DOM, ASTs, and so on. See [this "
"post](http://discuss.rust-lang.org/t/summary-of-efficient-inheritance-"
"rfcs/494/43) for some recent discussion."
msgstr ""

#: src/0341-remove-virtual-structs.md:25

"The implementation is somewhat buggy and incomplete, and the feature is not "
"well-documented."

#: src/0341-remove-virtual-structs.md:28
msgid ""
"Although it's behind a feature gate, keeping the feature around is still a "
"maintenance burden."

#: src/0341-remove-virtual-structs.md:39
msgid ""
"The language will no longer offer any built-in mechanism for avoiding "
"repetition of struct fields. Macros offer a reasonable workaround until a "
"more general mechanism is added."
