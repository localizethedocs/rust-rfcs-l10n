#: src/1361-cargo-cfg-dependencies.md:15
msgid ""
"Currently in Cargo it's [relatively painful](https://github.com/rust-lang/"
"cargo/issues/1007) to list target-specific dependencies. This can only be "
"done by listing out the entire target string as opposed to using the more-"
"convenient `#[cfg]` annotations that Rust source code has access to. "
"Consequently a Windows-specific dependency ends up having to be defined for "
"four triples: `{i686,x86_64}-pc-windows-{gnu,msvc}`, and this is "
"unfortunately not forwards compatible as well!"
msgstr ""

#: src/1361-cargo-cfg-dependencies.md:24
msgid ""
"As a result most crates end up unconditionally depending on target-specific "
"dependencies and rely on the crates themselves to have the relevant `#[cfg]` "
"to only be compiled for the right platforms. This experience leads to "
"excessive downloads, excessive compilations, and overall \"unclean methods\" "
"to have a platform specific dependency."

"Specifically, the \"target\" listed here is considered special if it starts "

"This is not a forwards-compatible extension to Cargo, so this will break "

"Have crates.io reject the `cfg` syntax until the implementation has landed "

"Crates on crates.io wishing for compatibility could simply hold off on using "

"Have crates.io rewrite dependencies as they're published. If you publish a "
