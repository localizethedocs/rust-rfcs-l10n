"Language RFCs are managed by the language sub-team, and tagged `T-lang`. The "
"language sub-team will do an initial triage of new PRs within a week of "
"submission. The result of triage will either be that the PR is assigned to a "
"member of the sub-team for shepherding, the PR is closed as postponed "
"because the subteam believe it might be a good idea, but is not currently "
"aligned with Rust's priorities, or the PR is closed because the sub-team "
"feel it should clearly not be done and further discussion is not necessary. "
"In the latter two cases, the sub-team will give a detailed explanation. "
"We'll follow the standard procedure for shepherding, final comment period, "
"etc."

"Sometimes in the implementation of an RFC, changes are required. In general "
"these don't require an RFC as long as they are very minor and in the spirit "
"of the accepted RFC (essentially bug fixes). In this case implementers "
"should submit an RFC PR which amends the accepted RFC with the new details. "
"Although the RFC repository is not intended as a reference manual, it is "
"preferred that RFCs do reflect what was actually implemented. Amendment RFCs "
"will go through the same process as regular RFCs, but should be less "
"controversial and thus should move more quickly."

"When a change is more dramatic, it is better to create a new RFC. The RFC "
"should be standalone and reference the original, rather than modifying the "
"existing RFC. You should add a comment to the original RFC with referencing "
"the new RFC as part of the PR."

"Obviously there is some scope for judgment here. As a guideline, if a change "
"affects more than one part of the RFC (i.e., is a non-local change), affects "
"the applicability of the RFC to its motivating use cases, or there are "
"multiple possible new solutions, then the feature is probably not 'minor' "
"and should get a new RFC."
