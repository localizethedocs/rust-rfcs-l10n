"The naming rules should apply not only to standard collections, but also to "

"naming consistency by preferring full names to abbreviated ones _when in "

"`Vec`: The name of the most frequently used Rust collection is left "

msgstr ""

"`BitVec`: `Bitv` is a very unusual abbreviation of `BitVector`, but `BitVec` "
"is a good one given `Vector` is shortened to `Vec`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0580-rename-collections.md:71
msgid ""
"`BitSet`: Technically, `BitSet` is a synonym of `BitVec(tor)`, but it has "
"`Set` in its name and can be interpreted as a set-like \"view\" into the "
"underlying bit array/vector, so `BitSet` is a good name. No need to have an "
"additional `v`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0580-rename-collections.md:72

"`LinkedList`: `DList` doesn't say much about what it actually is. "
"`LinkedList` is not too long (like `DoublyLinkedList`) and it being a doubly-"
"linked list follows Java/C#'s traditions."
msgstr ""

#: src/0580-rename-collections.md:73
msgid ""
"`VecDeque`: This name exposes some implementation details and signifies its "
"\"interface\" just like `HashSet`, and it doesn't have the \"fixed-size\" "

"`DoubleEndedQueue`, it is clear that the former should be chosen."
