"Add two functions, `ptr::read_unaligned` and `ptr::write_unaligned`, which "
"allows reading/writing to an unaligned pointer. All other functions that "
"access memory (`ptr::{read,write}`, `ptr::copy{_nonoverlapping}`, etc) "
"require that a pointer be suitably aligned for its type."

"The implementation of these functions are simple wrappers around `ptr::"

"not make any assumptions about the alignment."

"We could simply not add these, however figuring out how to do unaligned "
"access properly is extremely unintuitive: you need to cast the pointer to "
