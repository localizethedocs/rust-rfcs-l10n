msgid ""
"Thread locals are directly related to threading. Combining the modules would "
"reduce the number of top level modules, combine related concepts, and make "
"browsing the docs easier. It also would have the potential to slightly "
"reduce the number of `use` statements."

"The contents of`std::thread_local` module would be moved into to `std::"
"thread::local`. `Key` would be renamed to `LocalKey`, and `scoped` would "
"also be flattened, providing `ScopedKey`, etc. This way, all thread related "
"code is combined in one module."

"It's pretty late in the 1.0 release cycle. This is a mostly bike shedding "
"level of a change. It may not be worth changing it at this point and staying "
"with two top level modules in `std`. Also, some users may prefer to have "
"more top level modules."

"An alternative (as the RFC originally proposed) would be to bring "
"`thread_local` in as a submodule, rather than flattening. This was decided "
"against in an effort to keep hierarchies flat, and because of the slim "
"contents on the `thread_local` module."
