"There has [almost always been a desire](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/"
"issues/37) to be able to install Cargo packages locally, but it's been "
"somewhat unclear over time what the precise meaning of this is. Now that we "
"have crates.io and lots of experience with Cargo, however, the niche that "
"`cargo install` would fill is much clearer."
msgstr ""

#: src/1200-cargo-install.md:20

"Fundamentally, however, Cargo is a ubiquitous tool among the Rust community "
"and implementing `cargo install` would facilitate sharing Rust code among "
"its developers.  Simple tasks like installing a new cargo subcommand, "
"installing an editor plugin, etc, would be just a `cargo install` away. "

"seamless as possible."

"The primary alternative to putting effort behind `cargo install` is to "

"All in all, even if Cargo invested effort in facilitating creation of system "

"high**. If everything went according to plan it's just unfortunately "
"inherently complex to only distribute packages through a system package "

"Another possibility for `cargo install` is to not only be able to install "
"binaries, but also libraries. The meaning of this however, is pretty "
"nebulous and it's not clear that it's worthwhile. For example all Cargo "
"builds will not have access to these libraries (as Cargo retains control "
"over dependencies). It may mean that normal invocations of `rustc` have "
"access to these libraries (e.g. for small one-off scripts), but it's not "

msgstr ""

#: src/1200-cargo-install.md:253

"Another possible interpretation of installing libraries is that a developer "
"is informing Cargo that the library should be available in a pre-compiled "
"form. If any compile ends up using the library, then it can use the "
"precompiled form instead of recompiling it. This job, however, seems best "
"left to `cargo build` as it will automatically handle when the compiler "
"version changes, for example. It may also be more appropriate to add the "
"caching layer at the `cargo build` layer instead of `cargo install`."
