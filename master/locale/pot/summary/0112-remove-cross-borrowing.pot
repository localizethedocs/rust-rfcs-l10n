msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0112-remove-cross-borrowing.md:11
msgid ""
"Currently, the coercion between `Box<T>` to `&mut T` can be a hazard because "
"it can lead to surprising mutation where it was not expected."

msgid "Detailed design"

#: src/0112-remove-cross-borrowing.md:15
msgid "The coercion between `Box<T>` and `&mut T` should be removed."
msgstr ""

#: src/0112-remove-cross-borrowing.md:17
msgid ""
"Note that methods that take `&mut self` can still be called on values of "
"type `Box<T>` without any special referencing or dereferencing. That is "
"because the semantics of auto-deref and auto-ref conspire to make it work: "
"the types unify after one autoderef followed by one autoref."

"An alternative is to remove `&T` coercions as well, but this was decided "
"against as they are convenient."
