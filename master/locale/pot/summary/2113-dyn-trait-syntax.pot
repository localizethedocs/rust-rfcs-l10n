"The current syntax is often ambiguous and confusing, even to veterans, and "
"favors a feature that is not more frequently used than its alternatives, is "

"By itself, that's not enough to make a breaking change to syntax that's "
"already been stabilized. Now that we have editions, it won't have to be a "
"breaking change, but it will still cause significant churn. However, impl "
"Trait is going to require a significant shift in idioms and teaching "
"materials all on its own, and \"dyn Trait vs impl Trait\" is much nicer for "
"teaching and ergonomics than \"bare trait vs impl Trait\", so this author "
"believes it is worthwhile to change trait object syntax too."

msgid ""
"We could use a different keyword such as `obj` or `virtual`. There wasn't "
"very much discussion of these options on the original RFC thread, since the "
"motivation was a far bigger concern than the proposed syntax, so it wouldn't "
"be fair to say there's a consensus for or against any particular keyword."
msgstr ""

#: src/2113-dyn-trait-syntax.md:103
msgid ""
"This author believes that `dyn` is a better choice because the notion of "
"\"dynamic\" typing is familiar to a wide variety of programmers and unlikely "
"to mislead them. `obj` is likely to incorrectly imply an \"object\" in the "
"OOP sense, which is very different from a trait object. `virtual` is a term "
"that may be unfamiliar to programmers whose preferred languages don't have a "
"`virtual` keyword or don't even expose the notion of virtual/dynamic "
"dispatch to the programmer, and the languages that do have a `virtual` "
"keyword usually use it to mean \"this method can be overridden\", not \"this "
"value uses dynamic dispatch\"."
msgstr ""

#: src/2113-dyn-trait-syntax.md:105
msgid ""
"We could also use a more radical syntax for trait objects. `Object<Trait>` "
"was suggested on the original RFC thread but didn't gain much traction, "
"presumably because it adds more \"noise\" than a keyword and is arguably "
"misleading."
msgstr ""

#: src/2113-dyn-trait-syntax.md:107
msgid ""
"Finally, we could repurpose bare trait syntax for something other than trait "
"objects. It's been frequently suggested in the past that impl Trait would be "
"a far better candidate for bare trait syntax than trait objects. Even this "
"RFC's motivation section indirectly argues for this, e.g. impl Trait does "
"work with all traits and does not carry a runtime cost, unlike trait "
"objects. However, this RFC does not propose repurposing bare trait syntax "
"yet, only deprecating and removing it. This author believes dyn Trait is "
"worth adding even if we never repurpose bare trait, and repurposing it has "
"some significant downsides that dyn Trait does not (such as creating the "
"possibility of code that compiles in two different editions with radically "
"different semantics). This author believes the repurposing debate should "
"come later, probably after impl Trait and dyn Trait have been stabilized."
