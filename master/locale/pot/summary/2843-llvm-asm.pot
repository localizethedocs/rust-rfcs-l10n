msgid ""
"Deprecate the existing `asm!` macro and provide an identical one called "
"`llvm_asm!`. The feature gate is also renamed from `asm` to `llvm_asm`."
msgstr ""

#: src/2843-llvm-asm.md:12
msgid "Unlike `asm!`, `llvm_asm!` is not intended to ever become stable."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2843-llvm-asm.md:17
msgid ""
"This change frees up the `asm!` macro so that it can be used for the new "
"`asm!` macro designed by the inline asm project group while giving existing "
"users of `asm!` an easy way to keep their code working."
msgstr ""

#: src/2843-llvm-asm.md:21
msgid ""
"It may also be useful to have an inline asm implementation available (on "
"nightly) for architectures that the new `asm!` macro does not support yet."

msgid ""
"The Rust team is currently in the process of redesigning the `asm!` macro. "
"You should replace all uses of `asm!` with `llvm_asm!` in your code to avoid "
"breakage when the new `asm!` macro is implemented."

msgid ""
"All references to `asm!` inside the compiler will be changed to refer to "
"`llvm_asm!` instead. `asm!` will become a simple (deprecated) `macro_rules!` "
"which redirects to `llvm_asm!`. The deprecation warning will advise users "
"that the semantics of `asm!` will change in the future and invite them to "
"use `llvm_asm!` instead. The `llvm_asm!` macro will be guarded by the "
"`llvm_asm` feature gate."

msgid "Drawbacks"

#: src/2843-llvm-asm.md:40

"This change may require people to change their code twice: first to "
"`llvm_asm!`, and then to the new `asm!` macro once it is implemented."

#: src/2843-llvm-asm.md:46
msgid ""
"We could skip the deprecation period and perform the renaming at the same "
"time the new `asm!` macro is implemented. However this is guaranteed to "
"break a lot of code using nightly Rust at once without any transition period."

"The D programming language also support 2 forms of inline assembly. The "
"[first one](https://dlang.org/spec/iasm.html) provides an embedded DSL for "
"inline assembly, which allows direct access to variables in scope and does "
"not require the use of clobbers, but is only available on x86 and x86_64. "
"The [second one](https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC_inline_assembly_expressions) is "
"a raw interface to LLVM's internal inline assembly syntax, which is "
"available on all architectures but only on the LDC backend."

"When the [new `asm!` macro](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2873) is "
"implemented it will replace the current one. This will break anyone who has "
"not yet transitioned their code to `llvm_asm!`. No silent miscompilations "
"are expected since the operand separator will be changed from `:` to `,`, "
"which will guarantee that any existing `asm!` invocations will fail with a "
"syntax error with the new `asm!` macro."
