"There are a lot of macros out there that take literal constants as arguments "
"(often string constants). For now, most use the `expr` fragment specifier, "
"which is fine since literal constants are a subset of expressions. But it "
"has the following issues:"
msgstr ""

#: src/1576-macros-literal-matcher.md:19
msgid ""
"It restricts the syntax of those macros. A limited set of FOLLOW tokens is "
"allowed after an `expr` specifier. For example `$e:expr : $t:ty` is not "
"allowed whereas `$l:literal : $t:ty` should be. There is no reason to "
"arbitrarily restrict the syntax of those macros where they will only be "
"actually used with literal constants. A workaround for that is to use the "
"`tt` matcher."

"It does not allow for proper error reporting where the macro actually "
"_needs_ the parameter to be a literal constant. With this RFC, bad usage of "
"such macros will give a proper syntax error message whereas with `epxr` it "
"would probably give a syntax or typing error inside the generated code, "
"which is hard to understand."

"Add a `literal` (or `lit`, or `constant`) matcher in macro patterns that "
"matches all single-tokens literal constants (those that are currently "
"represented by `token::Literal`). Matching input against this matcher would "
"call the `parse_lit` method from `libsyntax::parse::Parser`. The FOLLOW set "
"of this matcher should be the same as `ident` since it matches a single "
"token."

"arrays `[some_literal ; N]`, where `some_literal` can itself be a compound "
"literal. See in alternatives why this is disallowed."

"Allow compound literals too. In theory there is no reason to exclude them "
"since they do not require any computation. In practice though, allowing them "
"requires using the expression parser but limiting it to allow only other "
"compound literals and not arbitrary expressions to occur inside a compound "
"literal (for example inside struct fields). This would probably require much "
"more work to implement and also mitigates the first motivation since it will "
"probably restrict a lot the FOLLOW set of such fragments."

"Adding fragment specifiers for each constant type: `$s:str` which expects a "
"literal string, `$i:integer` which expects a literal integer, etc. With this "
"design, we could allow something like `$s:struct` for compound literals "
"which still requires a lot of work to implement but has the advantage of not "
"‶polluting″ the FOLLOW sets of other specifiers such as `str`. It provides "
"also better ‶static″ (pre-expansion) checking of the arguments of a macro "
"and thus better error reporting. Types are also good for documentation. The "
"main drawback here if of course that we could not allow any possible type "
"since we cannot interleave parsing and type checking, so we would have to "
"define a list of accepted types, for example `str`, `integer`, `bool`, "
"`struct` and `array` (without specifying the complete type of the structs "
"and arrays). This would be a bit inconsistent since those types indeed refer "
"more to syntactic categories in this context than to true Rust types. It "
"would be frustrating and confusing since it can give the impression that "
"macros do type-checking of their arguments, when of course they don't."
