"Adding features to the language this late in the game is always somewhat of "
"a risky business. These features, while having baked for a few weeks, "
"haven't had much time to bake in the grand scheme of the language. These are "
"both backwards compatible to accept, and it could be argued that this could "
"be done later rather than sooner."

"In general, the major drawbacks of this RFC are the scheduling risks and "
"\"feature bloat\" worries. This RFC, however, is quite easy to implement "
"(reducing schedule risk) and concerns two fairly minor features which are "
"unambiguously nice to have."

"Instead of un-feature-gating before 1.0, these features could be released "
