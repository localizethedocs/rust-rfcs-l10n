"This file is typically checked in tree, so for many projects overriding "
"things involves making temporary changes to this, which feels hacky. On top "
"of this, if Cargo is being called by an encompassing build system as what "
"happens in Firefox, these changes can seem surprising."

"This also doesn't allow for much customization. For example, when trying to "
"optimize for compilation speed by building in debug mode, build scripts will "
"get built in debug mode as well. In case of complex build-time dependencies "
"like bindgen, this can end up significantly slowing down compilation. It "
"would be nice to be able to say \"build in debug mode, but build build "
"dependencies in release\". Also, your program may have large dependencies "
"that it doesn't use in critical paths, being able to ask for just these "
"dependencies to be run in debug mode would be nice."
