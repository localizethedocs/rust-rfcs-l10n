#: src/1014-stdout-existential-crisis.md:12
msgid ""
"On Linux `stdout` almost always exists, so when people write games and turn "
"off the terminal there is still an `stdout` that they write to. Then when "
"getting the code to run on Windows, when the console is disabled, suddenly "
"`stdout` doesn't exist and `println!` panicks. This behavior difference is "
"frustrating to developers trying to move to Windows."
msgstr ""

#: src/1014-stdout-existential-crisis.md:14

"There is also precedent with C and C++. On both Linux and Windows, if "
"`stdout` is closed or doesn't exist, neither platform will error when "
"attempting to print to the console."

"When using any of the convenience macros that write to either `stdout` or "
"`stderr`, such as `println!` `print!` `panic!` and `assert!`, change the "
"implementation to ignore the specific error of `stdout` or `stderr` not "
"existing. The behavior of all other errors will be unaffected. This can be "
"implemented by redirecting `stdout` and `stderr` to `std::io::sink` if the "
"original handles do not exist."

"For `std::io::stdin` `std::io::stdout` and `std::io::stderr`, make them "
