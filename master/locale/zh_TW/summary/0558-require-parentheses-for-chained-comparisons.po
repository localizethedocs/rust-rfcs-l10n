"Remove chaining of comparison operators (e.g. `a == b == c`) from the "

msgid ""
"This code is currently accepted and is evaluated as `((a == b) == c)`. This "
"may be confusing to programmers coming from languages like Python, where "
"chained comparison operators are evaluated as `(a == b && b == c)`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0558-require-parentheses-for-chained-comparisons.md:22
msgid ""
"In C, the same problem exists (and is exacerbated by implicit conversions). "
"Styleguides like Misra-C require the use of parentheses in this case."
msgstr ""

#: src/0558-require-parentheses-for-chained-comparisons.md:25
msgid ""
"By requiring the use of parentheses, we avoid potential confusion now, and "
"open up the possibility for python-like chained comparisons post-1.0."
msgstr ""

#: src/0558-require-parentheses-for-chained-comparisons.md:28
msgid ""
"Additionally, making the chain `f < b > (c)` invalid allows us to easily "
"produce a diagnostic message: \"Use `::<` instead of `<` if you meant to "
"specify type arguments.\", which would be a vast improvement over the "
"current diagnostics for this mistake."

"Emit a syntax error when a comparison operator appears as an operand of "
"another comparison operator (without being surrounded by parentheses). The "
"comparison operators are `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `==` and `!=`."

msgid "This is easily implemented directly in the parser."

"Note that this restriction on accepted syntax will effectively merge the "
"precedence level 4 (`<` `>` `<=` `>=`) with level 3 (`==` `!=`)."

"In particular, code that currently uses the difference between precedence "

"However, I don't think this kind of code sees much use. The rustc codebase "
"doesn't seem to have any occurrences of chained comparisons."

msgid "Alternatives"
msgstr ""

#: src/0558-require-parentheses-for-chained-comparisons.md:58
msgid ""
"As this RFC just makes the chained comparison syntax available for post-1.0 "
"language features, pretty much every alternative (including returning to the "
"status quo) can still be implemented later."
msgstr ""

#: src/0558-require-parentheses-for-chained-comparisons.md:61

"If this RFC is not accepted, it will be impossible to add python-style "
"chained comparison operators later."
msgstr ""

#: src/0558-require-parentheses-for-chained-comparisons.md:63
msgid ""
"A variation on this RFC would be to keep the separation between precedence "
"level 3 and 4, and only reject programs where a comparison operator appears "
"as an operand of another comparison operator of the same precedence level. "
"This minimizes the breaking changes, but does not allow full python-style "
"chained comparison operators in the future (although a more limited form of "
"them would still be possible)."
