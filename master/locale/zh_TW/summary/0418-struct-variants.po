"Tuple variants with multiple fields can become difficult to work with, "
"especially when the types of the fields don't make it obvious what each one "
"is. It is not an uncommon sight in the compiler to see inline comments used "
"to help identify the various variants of an enum, such as this snippet from "
"`rustc::middle::def`:"
