"The core idea of the RFC is to unify closures, procs, and traits. There are "
"a number of reasons to do this. First, it simplifies the language, because "
"closures, procs, and traits already served similar roles and there was "
"sometimes a lack of clarity about which would be the appropriate choice. "

"power, because traits are a more generic model that gives users more control "
"over optimization."

"**Introduce a more generic sugar.** It was proposed that we could introduce "
