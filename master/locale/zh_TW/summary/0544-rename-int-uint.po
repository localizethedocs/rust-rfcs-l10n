"Currently, Rust defines two [machine-dependent integer types](http://doc."
"rust-lang.org/reference.html#machine-dependent-integer-types) `int/uint` "
"that have the same number of bits as the target platform's pointer type. "
"These two types are used for many purposes: indices, counts, sizes, offsets, "
"etc."
msgstr ""

#: src/0544-rename-int-uint.md:13

"The problem is, `int/uint` _look_ like default integer types, but pointer-"

"people from overusing them."

"`int/uint` have a long tradition of being the default integer type names, so "
