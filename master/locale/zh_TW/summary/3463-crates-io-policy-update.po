"Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected "

#: src/3463-crates-io-policy-update.md:14
msgid ""
"crates.io has a \"[Package Policies](https://crates.io/policies)\" page, "
"which describes the current, organically grown policies. A lot of support "
"requests or questionable uses of crates.io however need explicit decisions "
"from the crates.io team, since many cases are currently not covered by these "
"policies. Additionally, decisions made by the team may be seen as arbitrary "
"without written guidelines."

"The situation around name squatting has lately also reached unsustainable "

"name squatting namespaces then."

"The main motivation for this RFC is to give the crates.io team a fixed set "

"or if the user should get a warning and the project potentially be removed. "
"It is mostly codifying the existing practices of the team, except for being "
"more strict regarding name squatting."
