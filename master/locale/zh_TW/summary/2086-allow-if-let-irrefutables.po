msgid ""
"Currently when using an if let statement and an irrefutable pattern (read "
"always match) is used the compiler complains with an `E0162: irrefutable if-"
"let pattern`. The current state breaks macros who want to accept patterns "
"generically and this RFC proposes changing this error to an error-by-default "
"lint which is allowed to be disabled by such macros."

#: src/2086-allow-if-let-irrefutables.md:15
msgid ""
"The use cases for this is in the creation of macros where patterns are "
"allowed because to support the `_` patterns the code has to be rewritten to "
"be both much larger and include an \\[#allow\\] statement for a lint that "
"does not seem to be related to the problem. The expected outcome is for "
"irrefutable patterns to be compiled to a tautology and have the if block "
"accept it as if it was `if true { }`. To support this, currently you must do "
"something roughly the following, which seems to counteract the benefit of "
"having if-let and while-let in the spec."

"The following cannot be used, so the previous must be. An "
"`#[allow(irrefutable_let_pattern)]` is used so that the error-by-default "
"lint does not appear to the user."

"It allows programmers to manually write the line `if let _ = expr { } else "
"{ }` which is generally obfuscating and not desirable. However, this will "

"The trivial alternative: Do nothing. As your motivation explains, this only "
"matters for macros anyways plus there already is an acceptable workaround "
"(match). Code that needs this frequently can just package this workaround in "
"its own macro and be done."
