"Conceptually, strings and slices are similar types. Many methods are already "
"shared between the two types due to their similarity. However, not all "
"methods are shared between the types, even though many could be. This is a "
"little unexpected and inconsistent. Because of that, this RFC proposes to "
"remedy this by adding a few methods to strings to even out these two types’ "
"available methods."

"Specifically, it is currently very difficult to construct a `Box<str>`, "
"while it is fairly simple to make a `Box<[T]>` by using `Vec::"
"into_boxed_slice`. This RFC proposes a means of creating a `Box<str>` by "
"converting a `String`."
