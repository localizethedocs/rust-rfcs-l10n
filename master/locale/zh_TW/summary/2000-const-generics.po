msgid "Motivation"
msgstr "動機"

#: src/2000-const-generics.md:15
msgid ""
"Rust currently has one type which is parametric over constants: the built-in "
"array type `[T; LEN]`. However, because const generics are not a first class "
"feature, users cannot define their own types which are generic over constant "
"values, and cannot implement traits for all arrays."
msgstr ""

#: src/2000-const-generics.md:20
msgid ""
"As a result of this limitation, the standard library only contains trait "
"implementations for arrays up to a length of 32; as a result, arrays are "
"often treated as a second-class language feature. Even if the length of an "
"array might be statically known, it is more common to heap allocate it using "
"a vector than to use an array type (which has certain performance trade "
"offs)."
msgstr ""

#: src/2000-const-generics.md:26
msgid ""
"Const parameters can also be used to allow users to more naturally specify "
"variants of a generic type which are more accurately reflected as values, "
"rather than types. For example, if a type takes a name as a parameter for "
"configuration or other reasons, it may make more sense to take a `&'static "
"str` than take a unit type which provides the name (through an associated "
"const or function). This can simplify APIs."
msgstr ""

#: src/2000-const-generics.md:33
msgid ""
"Lastly, consts can be used as parameters to make certain values determined "
"at typecheck time. By limiting which values a trait is implemented over, the "
"orphan rules can enable a crate to ensure that only some safe values are "
"used, with the check performed at compile time (this is especially relevant "
"to cryptographic libraries for example)."

"Today, types in Rust can be parameterized by two kinds: types and lifetimes. "
"We will additionally allow types to be parameterized by values, so long as "
"those values can be computed at compile time. A single constant parameter "
"must be of a single, particular type, and can be validly substituted with "
"any value of that type which can be computed at compile time and the type "
"meets the equality requirements laid out later in this RFC."

"The structural match property is intended as a stopgap until a final "

"For this reason we will (initially, at least) treat the return value of "
