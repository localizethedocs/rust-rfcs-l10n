"Add a `lifetime` specifier for `macro_rules!` patterns, that matches any "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/1590-macro-lifetimes.md:15
msgid ""
"Certain classes of macros are completely impossible without the ability to "
"pass lifetimes. Specifically, anything that wants to implement a trait from "
"inside of a macro is going to need to deal with lifetimes eventually. "
"They're also commonly needed for any macros that need to deal with types in "
"a more granular way than just `ty`."
msgstr ""

#: src/1590-macro-lifetimes.md:21
msgid ""
"Since a lifetime is a single token, the only way to match against a lifetime "
"is by capturing it as `tt`. Something like `'$lifetime:ident` would fail to "
"compile. This is extremely limiting, as it becomes difficult to sanitize "
"input, and `tt` is extremely difficult to use in a sequence without using "
"awkward separators."

msgid ""
"This RFC proposes adding `lifetime` as an additional specifier to "
"`macro_rules!` (alternatively: `life` or `lt`). As it is a single token, it "
"is able to be followed by any other specifier. Since a lifetime acts very "
"much like an identifier, and can appear in almost as many places, it can be "
"handled almost identically."

"A more general specifier, such as a \"type parameter list\", which would "
