"`assert_ne` is a macro that takes 2 arguments and panics if they are equal. "
"It works and is implemented identically to `assert_eq` and serves as its "
"complement. This proposal also includes a `debug_asset_ne`, matching "
"`debug_assert_eq`."

"This feature, among other reasons, makes testing more readable and "
"consistent as it complements `asset_eq`. It gives the same style panic "
"message as `assert_eq`, which eliminates the need to write it yourself."

msgid ""
"Any addition to the standard library will need to be maintained forever, so "
"it is worth weighing the maintenance cost of this over the value add. Given "
