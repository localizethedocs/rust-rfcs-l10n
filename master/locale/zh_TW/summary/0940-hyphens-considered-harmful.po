#: src/0940-hyphens-considered-harmful.md:14
msgid ""
"First: hyphens in crate names are awkward to use, and inconsistent with the "
"rest of the language. Anyone who uses such a crate must rename it on import:"

"An earlier version of this RFC aimed to solve this issue by removing hyphens "
"entirely."

msgid ""
"However, there is a large amount of precedent for keeping `-` in package "
"names. Systems as varied as GitHub, npm, RubyGems and Debian all have an "
"established convention of using hyphens. Disallowing them would go against "
"this precedent, causing friction with the wider community."
msgstr ""

#: src/0940-hyphens-considered-harmful.md:24
msgid ""
"Fortunately, Cargo presents us with a solution. It already separates the "
"concepts of _package name_ (used by Cargo and crates.io) and _crate name_ "
"(used by rustc and `extern crate`). We can disallow hyphens in the crate "
"name only, while still accepting them in the outer package. This solves the "
"usability problem, while keeping with the broader convention."

"The difference will be in the crate name Cargo passes to the compiler. If "

"To ease the transition, keep the old `extern crate` syntax around, "

"\"silver-spoon\" as spoon;` will be desugared to `extern crate silver_spoon "
