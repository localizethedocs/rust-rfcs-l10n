"We intend to add some mechanism to Rust to support more efficient "
"inheritance (see, e.g., RFC PRs #245 and #250, and this [thread](http://"
"discuss.rust-lang.org/t/summary-of-efficient-inheritance-rfcs/494/43) on "
"discuss). Although we have not decided how to do this, we do know that we "
"will. Any implementation is likely to make use of keywords `virtual` "
"(already used, to remain reserved), `abstract`, `final`, and `override`, so "
"it makes sense to reserve these now to make the eventual implementation as "
"backwards compatible as possible."
