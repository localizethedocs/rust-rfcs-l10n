"Lexing all digits (even ones not valid in the given base) allows for "
"improved error messages & future proofing (this is more conservative than "
"the current approach) and less confusion, with little downside."

"Currently, the lexer stops lexing binary and octal literals (`0b10` and "
"`0o12345670`) as soon as it sees an invalid digit (2-9 or 8-9 respectively), "
"and immediately starts lexing a new token, e.g. `0b0123` is two tokens, "
"`0b01` and `23`. Writing such a thing in normal code gives a strange error "
"message:"

#: src/0879-small-base-lexing.md:28

"However, it is valid to write such a thing in a macro (e.g. using the `tt` "
"non-terminal), and thus lexing the adjacent digits as two tokens can lead to "
"unexpected behaviour."

"This adds a slightly peculiar special case, that is somewhat unique to Rust. "
"On the other hand, most languages do not expose the lexical grammar so "
"directly, and so have more freedom in this respect. That is, in many "

"_always_ an error either way."
