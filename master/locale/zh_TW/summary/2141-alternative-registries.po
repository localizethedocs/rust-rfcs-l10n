"This RFC proposes the addition of the support for alternative crates.io "

msgstr ""

#: src/2141-alternative-registries.md:16
msgid ""
"Cargo currently has support for getting crates from a public server, which "
"works well for open source projects using Rust, however is problematic for "
"closed source code. A workaround for this is to use Git repositories to "
"specify the packages, but that means that the helpful versioning and "
"discoverability that Cargo and crates.io provides is lost. We would like to "
"change this such that it is possible to have a local crates.io server which "
"crates can be pushed to, while still making use of the public crates.io "
"server."

"We need a way to define what registries are valid for Cargo to pull from and "
"publish to. For this purpose, we propose that users would be able to define "
"multiple registries in a [`.cargo/config` file](http://doc.crates.io/config."
"html). This allows the user to specify the locations of registries in one "
"place, in a parent directory of all projects, rather than needing to "
"configure the registry location within each project's `Cargo.toml`. Once a "
"registry has been configured with a name, each `Cargo.toml` can use the "
"registry name to refer to that registry."
msgstr ""

#: src/2141-alternative-registries.md:36

"Another benefit of using `.cargo/config` is that these files are not "
"typically checked in to the projects' source control. The registries might "

"security practices of not checking in credentials."

"Supporting alternative registries, and having multiple public registries, "
"could fracture the ecosystem. However, we feel that supporting private "
"registries, and the Rust adoption that could enable, outweighs the potential "
"downsides of having multiple public registries."

"A [previous RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2006) proposed "
"having the registry information completely defined within `Cargo.toml` "
"rather than using `.cargo/config`. This requires repeating the same "
"information multiple times for multiple projects, and encourages checking in "
"credentials that might be needed to access the registries. That RFC also "
"didn't specify the format for the registry index, which needs to be shared "
"among all registries."

"An alternative design could be to support specifying the registry URL in "
"either `.cargo/config` or `Cargo.toml`. This has the downsides of creating "
"more choices for the user and potentially encouraging poor practices such as "
"checking credentials into a project's source control. The implementation of "
"this feature would also be more complex. The upside would be supporting "
"configuration in ways that would be more convenient in various situations."
