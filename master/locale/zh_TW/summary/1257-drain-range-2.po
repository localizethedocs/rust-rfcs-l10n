#: src/1257-drain-range-2.md:12
msgid ""
"The `drain` methods and their draining iterators serve to mass remove "
"elements from a collection, receiving them by value in an iterator, while "
"the collection keeps its allocation intact (if applicable)."
msgstr ""

#: src/1257-drain-range-2.md:16
msgid ""
"The range parameterized variants of drain are a generalization of `drain`, "
"to affect just a subrange of the collection, for example removing just an "
"index range from a vector."
msgstr ""

#: src/1257-drain-range-2.md:20
msgid ""
"`drain` thus serves both to consume all or some elements from a collection "
"without consuming the collection itself. The ranged `drain` allows bulk "
"removal of elements, more efficiently than any other safe API."

"Implement `.drain(a..b)` where `a` and `b` are indices, for all collections "
"that are sequences."

"Implement `.drain()` for other collections. This is just like `.drain(..)` "
"would be (drain the whole collection)."

#: src/1257-drain-range-2.md:30
msgid ""
"Ranged drain accepts all range types, currently .., a.., ..b, a..b, and "
"drain will accept inclusive end ranges (\"closed ranges\") when they are "
