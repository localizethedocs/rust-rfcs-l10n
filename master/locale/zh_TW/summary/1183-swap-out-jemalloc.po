"Currently all Rust programs by default use jemalloc for an allocator because "
"it is a fairly reasonable default as it is commonly much faster than the "
"default system allocator. This is not desirable, however, when embedding "
"Rust code into other runtimes. Using jemalloc implies that Rust will be "
"using one allocator while the host application (e.g. Ruby, Firefox, etc) "
"will be using a separate allocator. Having two allocators in one process "
"generally hurts performance and is not recommended, so the Rust toolchain "
"needs to provide a method to configure the allocator."

#: src/1183-swap-out-jemalloc.md:31

"In addition to using an entirely separate allocator altogether, some Rust "
"programs may want to simply instrument allocations or shim in additional "
