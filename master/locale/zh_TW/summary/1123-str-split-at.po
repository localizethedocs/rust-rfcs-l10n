"Introduce the method `split_at(&self, mid: usize) -> (&str, &str)` on `str`, "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/1123-str-split-at.md:13
msgid ""
"Adding `split_at` is a measure to provide a method from `[T]` in a version "
"that makes sense for `str`."

"Once used to `[T]`, users might even expect that `split_at` is present on "
"str."

"It is a simple method with an obvious implementation, but it provides "
"convenience while working with string segmentation manually, which we "
"already have ample tools for (for example the method `find` that returns the "
"first matching byte offset)."

#: src/1123-str-split-at.md:23

"Using `split_at` can lead to less repeated bounds checks, since it is easy "
"to use cumulatively, splitting off a piece at a time."

"`split_at` will use a byte offset (a.k.a byte index) to be consistent with "
