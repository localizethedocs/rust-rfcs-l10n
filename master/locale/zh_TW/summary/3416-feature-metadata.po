"Features are widely used as a way to do things like reduce dependency count, "
"gate `std` or `alloc`\\-dependent parts of code, or hide unstable API. Use "
"is so common that many larger crates wind up with tens of feature gates, "
"such as [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/crate/tokio/latest/features) with 24. "
"Despite being a first class component of crate structure, there are some "
"limitations that don't have elegant solutions:"
