"The [`str::words`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method."
"words) method is currently marked `#[unstable(reason = \"the precise "
"algorithm to use is unclear\")]`. Indeed, the concept of “a word” is not "
"easy to define in presence of punctuation or languages with various "
"conventions, including not using spaces at all to separate words."

"It is not possible to provide a uniform set of rules that resolves all "
