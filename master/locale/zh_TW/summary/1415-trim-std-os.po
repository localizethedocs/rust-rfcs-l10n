"[RFC 517](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0517-io-os-"
"reform.md) set forth a vision for the `raw` modules in the standard library "
"to perform lowering operations on various Rust types to their platform "
"equivalents. For example the `fs::Metadata` structure can be lowered to the "
"underlying `sys::stat` structure. The rationale for this was to enable "
"building abstractions externally from the standard library by exposing all "
"of the underlying data that is obtained from the OS."

"For some libc structures, such as `stat`, there's not actually one canonical "
"definition. For example on 32-bit Linux the definition of `stat` will change "
"depending on whether [LFS](http://users.suse.com/~aj/linux_lfs.html) is "
"enabled (via the `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS` macro).  This means that if std is "
"advertises these `raw` types as being \"FFI compatible with libc\", it's not "

"Next, all existing extension traits will cease to return platform specific "

"return `u64` across the board unless it's 100% known for sure that fewer "
"bits will suffice. This will improve consistency across platforms as well as "
"avoid truncation problems such as those Android is experiencing. Furthermore "

"The `std::os::*::fs::MetadataExt` will have its `as_raw_stat` method "
