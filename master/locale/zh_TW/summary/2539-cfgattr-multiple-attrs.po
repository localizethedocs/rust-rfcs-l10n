"Simply put, ergonomics and intent. When you have multiple attributes you "
"configure away behind the same predicate today, you need to duplicate the "
"entire predicate. And then when you read code that does this, you have to "
"check the entire predicates with each other to make sure they're the same. "
"By allowing multiple attributes it removes that duplication and shows "
"explicitly that the author wanted those attributes configured behind the "
"same predicate."

"We could require that multiple attributes must be within in a delimiter to "

"`#[cfg_attr(predicate, [attr, attr])]`. While this could increase clarity, "
"it mostly seems like it would just add noise. In the multiline case, it "
"already reads pretty clear with the predicate on the first line and each "
"attribute indented."

"The default alternative of not doing this is a possibility. It would just "

"We could change attribute container syntax to allow multiple attributes and "
"then state that `cfg_attr` takes the attribute container syntax without the "
"`#[]` part. While this could be a good final state, it's a more ambitious "
"change that has more drawbacks. There are legitimate reasons we'd want "
"`cfg_attr` to take multiple attributes but not the attribute container. As "
"such, I would like to go with the conservative change first."
