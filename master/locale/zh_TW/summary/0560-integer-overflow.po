"Change the semantics of the built-in fixed-size integer types from being "

"error (but _not_ undefined behavior in the C sense). Implementations are "
"_permitted_ to check for overflow at any time (statically or dynamically). "
"Implementations are _required_ to at least check dynamically when "
"`debug_assert!` assertions are enabled. Add a `WrappingOps` trait to the "
"standard library with operations defined as wrapping on overflow for the "
"limited number of cases where this is the desired semantics, such as hash "

msgid ""
"Numeric overflow prevents a difficult situation. On the one hand, overflow "
"(and [underflow](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide."
"html#Integer_Types)) is known to be a common source of error in other "
"languages. Rust, at least, does not have to worry about memory safety "
"violations, but it is still possible for overflow to lead to bugs. Moreover, "
"Rust's safety guarantees do not apply to `unsafe` code, which carries the "
"[same risks as C code when it comes to overflow](http://phrack.org/"
"issues/60/10.html#article). Unfortunately, banning overflow outright is not "
"feasible at this time. Detecting overflow statically is not practical, and "
"detecting it dynamically can be costly. Therefore, we have to steer a middle "
"ground."

"**Making choices is hard.** Having to think about whether wraparound "

"**Loss of additive commutativity and benign overflows.** In some cases, "
"overflow behavior can be benign. For example, given an expression like `a+b-"
"c`, intermediate overflows are not harmful so long as the final result is "
"within the range of the integral type.  To take advantage of this property, "
"code would have to be written to use the wrapping constructs, such as `a."
"wrapping_add(b).wrapping_sub(c)`. However, this drawback is counterbalanced "
"by the large number of arithmetic expressions which do not have the same "

"typical ingredient for [binary searches and the like](http://googleresearch."
"blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html) and can lead "

"**Danger of triggering additional panics from within unsafe code.** This "
"proposal creates more possibility for panics to occur, at least when checks "

"code is not exception safe. This is particularly worrisome in unsafe code, "
"where crucial safety guarantees can be violated. However, this danger "
"already exists, as there are numerous ways to trigger a panic, and hence "
"unsafe code must be written with this in mind.  It seems like the best "
"advice is for unsafe code to eschew the plain `+` and `-` operators, and "
"instead prefer explicit checked or wrapping operations as appropriate (hence "

"applications run tests both with and without optimizations (and debug "
"assertions). That said, this state of affairs already exists. First, the use "
"of `debug_assert!` causes debug/optimized code to diverge, but also, "
"optimizations are known to cause non-trivial changes in behavior. For "
"example, recursive (but pure) functions may be optimized away entirely by "
"LLVM. Therefore, it always makes sense to run tests in both modes. This "
"situation is not unique to Rust; most major projects do something similar. "

"in optimized builds, overflow checking will not be enabled. Certainly if we "
