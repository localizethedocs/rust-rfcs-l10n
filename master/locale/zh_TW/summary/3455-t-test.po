msgid ""
"Currently, the overall automated testing experience spans multiple "
"components owned by different teams across the Rust Project (e.g. T-cargo "
"with `cargo test` being the primary touch point for most users, T-libs for "
"libtest, T-rustdoc for doctests, etc.). This makes it more difficult to "
"establish a vision and coordinate efforts to achieve that vision. However, "
"there isn't any single team focused on the testing picture holistically. "
"Simultaneously, there are a number of well known needs and feature requests "
"in the space that do not have an explicit owner driving the efforts to "
"completion."

msgid ""
"For example, there's been some long standing requests to have additional "
"test output formats, such as JSON ([\\#49359](https://github.com/rust-lang/"
"rust/issues/49359)) and JUnit, available on Stable Rust. While some of these "
"are available as unstable features in Nightly Rust, in [Rust 1.70.0](https://"
"blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/01/Rust-1.70.0.html), a bug was fixed so unstable "
"test features, like `cargo test -- --format json`, require using a nightly "
"toolchain, like other unstable features. This caused breakage in certain "
"editor/IDE and CI related tooling as they had been relying on the prior "
"behavior to get test data programmatically, and little progress has been "
"made in the last 5 years ([\\#49359](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"
"issues/49359))."

"implementing-test-binary-list-format-json-for-use-by-ide-test-explorers-"
"runners/18308)) as well as requests for things like better support for "
