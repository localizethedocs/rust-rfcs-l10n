"Crates.io has many useful libraries for a variety of purposes, but it's "

"Finding and evaluating crates can be time consuming. People already familiar "
"with the Rust ecosystem often know which crates are best for which puproses, "
"but we want to share that knowledge with everyone. For example, someone "
"looking for a crate to help create a parser should be able to navigate to a "
"category for that purpose and get a list of crates to consider. This list "
"would include crates such as [nom](https://crates.io/crates/nom) and "
"[peresil](https://crates.io/crates/peresil), and the order in which they "
"appear should be significant and should help make the decision between the "
"crates in this category easier."
