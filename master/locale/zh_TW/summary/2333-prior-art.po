msgid ""
"For additions to the standard library in particular, it should carry some "

"This is the chief motivation of this RFC. By explicitly asking authors for "
"information about the similarity of their proposal to those in other "
"languages, we may get more information which aids us in better evaluating "
"RFCs. Merely name dropping that a language has a certain feature is not all "
"- a discussion of the experience the communities of the language in question "
"has had is more useful. A proposal need also not be a language or library "
"proposal. If a proposal is made for changes to how we work as a community, "
"it can be especially valuable how other communities have tackled a similar "
"situation."

"During the process of writing an RFC, an author may change certain aspects "

"RFC, change certain aspects in a more radical way, and so on. Here, the "
"benefit of explicitly asking for and about prior art is that it makes the "
"RFC author think about the proposal in relation to other languages. In "
"search for this information, the author can come to new or better "
"realizations about the trade-offs, advantages, and drawbacks of their "
"proposal. Thus, their RFC as a whole is hopefully improved as a by-product."

"This Meta-RFC modifies the RFC template by adding a _Prior art_ section "

msgstr ""

#: src/2333-prior-art.md:121
msgid ""
"This might encourage RFC authors into the thinking that just because a "
"feature exists in one language, it should also exist in Rust and that this "
"can be the sole argument. This RFC argues that the risk of this is small, "
"and that with a clear textual instruction in the RFC template, we can reduce "
"it even further."
msgstr ""

#: src/2333-prior-art.md:126
msgid ""
"Another potential drawback is the risk that in a majority of cases, the "
"prior art section will simply be left empty with \"N/A\". Even if this is "
"the case, there will still be an improvement to the minority of RFCs that do "
"include a review of prior art. Furthermore, this the changes to the template "
"proposed in this RFC are by no means irreversible. If we find out after some "
"time that this was a bad idea, we can always revert back to the way it was "
"before."
msgstr ""

#: src/2333-prior-art.md:133
msgid ""
"Finally, a longer template risks making it harder to contribute to the RFC "
"process as an author as you are expected to fill in more sections. Some "
"people who don't know a lot of other languages may be intimidated into "
"thinking that they are expected to know a wide variety of languages and that "
"their contribution is not welcome otherwise. This drawback can be mitigated "
"by more clearly communicating that the RFC process is a collaborative "
"effort. If an author does not have prior art to offer up right away, other "
"participants in the RFC discussion may be able to provide such information "
"which can then be amended into the RFC."

msgid ""
"As always, there is the simple alternative of not doing the changes proposed "
"in the RFC."
msgstr ""

#: src/2333-prior-art.md:152
msgid ""
"Other than that, we can come to the understanding that those that want may "
"include a prior art section if they wish, even if it is not in the template. "
"This is already the case - authors can always provide extra information. The "
"benefit of asking for the information explicitly in the template is that "
"more authors are likely to provide such information. This is discussed more "
"in the [motivation](#motivation)."
msgstr ""

#: src/2333-prior-art.md:159
msgid ""
"Finally, we can ask for information about prior art to be provided in each "
"section (motivation, guide-level explanation, etc.). This is however likely "
"to reduce the coherence and readability of RFCs. This RFC argues that it is "
"better that prior art be discussed in one coherent section. This is also "
"similar to how papers are structured in that they include a \"related work\" "
"section."
msgstr ""

#: src/2333-prior-art.md:168
msgid ""
"In many papers, a section entitled _Related work_ is included which can be "
"likened to this section. To not drive readers away or be attention stealing "
"from the main contributions of a paper, it is usually recommended that this "
"section be placed near the end of papers. For the reasons mentioned, this is "
"a good idea - and so to achieve the same effect, the section you are "
"currently reading will be placed precisely where it is placed right now, "
"that is, before the _Unresolved questions_ section, which we can liken to a "
"_Future work_ section inside a paper."
