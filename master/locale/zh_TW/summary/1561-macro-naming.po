"This RFC proposes making macros a first-class citizen in the Rust module "
"system. Both macros by example (`macro_rules` macros) and procedural macros "
"(aka syntax extensions) would use the same naming and modularisation scheme "

"For procedural macros, this RFC could be implemented immediately or as part "
"of a larger effort to reform procedural macros. For macros by example, this "
"would be part of a macros 2.0 feature, the rest of which will be described "
"in a separate RFC. This RFC depends on the changes to name resolution "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/1561-macro-naming.md:25
msgid ""
"Currently, procedural macros are not modularised at all (beyond the crate "
"level). Macros by example have a [custom modularisation scheme](https://"
"github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0453-macro-reform.md) which "
"involves modules to some extent, but relies on source ordering and "
"attributes which are not used for other items. Macros cannot be imported or "
"named using the usual syntax. It is confusing that macros use their own "
"system for modularisation. It would be far nicer if they were a more regular "
"feature of Rust in this respect."

"This RFC does not propose changes to macro definitions. It is envisaged that "
"definitions of procedural macros will change, see [this blog post](http://"
"ncameron.org/blog/macro-plans-syntax/) for some rough ideas. I'm assuming "
"that procedural macros will be defined in some function-like way and that "
"these functions will be defined in modules in their own crate (to start "
"with)."
msgstr ""

#: src/1561-macro-naming.md:46
msgid ""
"Ordering of macro definitions in the source text will no longer be "
"significant. A macro may be used before it is defined, as long as it can be "
"named. That is, macros follow the same rules regarding ordering as other "
"items. E.g., this will work:"

"Macro expansion order is also not defined by source order. E.g., in `foo!(); "
"bar!();`, `bar` may be expanded before `foo`. Ordering is only guaranteed as "
"far as it is necessary. E.g., if `bar` is only defined by expanding `foo`, "
