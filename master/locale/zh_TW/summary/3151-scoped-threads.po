"Before Rust 1.0 was released, we had [`thread::scoped()`](https://docs.rs/"
"thread-scoped/1.0.2/thread_scoped/) with the same purpose as scoped threads, "
"but then discovered it has a soundness issue that could lead to use-after-"

"Fortunately, the old scoped threads could be fixed by relying on closures "
"rather than guards to ensure spawned threads get automatically joined. But "
"we weren't feeling completely comfortable with including scoped threads in "
"Rust 1.0 so it was decided they should live in external crates, with the "
"possibility of going back into the standard library sometime in the future. "
