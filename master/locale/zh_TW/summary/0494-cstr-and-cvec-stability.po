"The new `CString` API is focused solely on providing a static assertion that "

"`Vec` is usable as a slice, but a `CString` can also be viewed as a byte "
"slice with a concrete `u8` type. The default of `libc::c_char` was chosen to "

"One of the major departures from today's API is how a `CString` is "
"constructed. Today this can be done through the `CString::new` function or "
"the `ToCStr` trait. These two construction vectors serve two very different "
"purposes, one for C-originating data and one for Rust-originating data. This "
"redesign of `CString` is solely focused on going from Rust to C (case 1 "
"above) and only supports constructors in this flavor."

#: src/0494-c_str-and-c_vec-stability.md:103
msgid ""
"The first constructor, `from_slice`, is intended to allow `CString` to "
"implement an on-the-stack buffer optimization in the future without having "
"to resort to a `Vec` with its allocation. This is similar to the "
"optimization performed by `with_c_str` today. Of the other two constructors, "
"`from_vec` will consume a vector, assert there are no 0 bytes, an then push "
"a 0 byte on the end. The `from_vec_unchecked` constructor will not perform "
"the verification, but will still push a zero. Note that both of these "
"constructors expose the fact that a `CString` is not necessarily valid UTF-8."

"module is attempting to solve, but it does so in a somewhat ad-hoc fashion. "
"The constructor for the type takes a `proc` destructor to invoke when the "
