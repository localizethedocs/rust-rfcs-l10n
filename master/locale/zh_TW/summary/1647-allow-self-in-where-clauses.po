"`Self` is a useful tool to have to reduce churn when the type changes for "
"various reasons. One would expect to be able to write"

"but this will fail to compile today, forcing you to repeat the type, and "
"adding one more place that has to change if the type ever changes."

"By this same logic, we would also like to be able to reference associated "
"types from the traits being implemented. When dealing with generic code, "
"patterns like this often emerge:"
msgstr ""

#: src/1647-allow-self-in-where-clauses.md:43
msgid ""
"the only reason the associated type is repeated at all is to restate the "
"bound on the associated type. It would be nice to reduce some of that "
"duplication."

"Instead of blocking `Self` from being used in the \"header\" of a trait "
"impl, it will be understood to be a reference to the implementation type. "
"For example, all of these would be valid:"

"If the `Self` type is parameterized by `Self`, an error that the type "
