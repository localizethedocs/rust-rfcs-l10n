"`#[test]` is used to mark functions to be run as part of a test suite. The "
"functions being marked need to be addressable for this to work. Currently, "
"marking an inner function as `#[test]` will not raise any errors or "
"warnings, but the test will silently not be run. By adding a lint that "
"identifies these cases, users are less likely to fail to notice."
