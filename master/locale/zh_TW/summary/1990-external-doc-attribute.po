"Documentation is an important part of any project, it allows developers to "
"explain how to use items within a library as well as communicate the intent "
"of how to use it through examples. Rust has long championed this feature "
"through the use of documentation comments and `rustdoc` to generate "
"beautiful, easy to navigate documentation. However, there is no way right "
"now to have documentation be imported into the code from an external file. "
"This RFC proposes a way to extend the functionality of Rust to include this "
"ability."

"Many smaller crates are able to do all of the documentation that's needed in "
"a README file within their repo. Being able to include this as a crate or "
"module level doc comment would mean not having to duplicate documentation "
"and is easier to maintain. This means that one could run `cargo doc` with "
"the small crate as a dependency and be able to access the contents of the "
"README without needing to go online to the repo to read it. This also would "
"help with [this issue on crates.io](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/"
"issues/81) by making it easy to have the README in the crate and the crate "
"root at the same."

"The feature would provide a way to have easier to read code for library "
"maintainers. Sometimes doc comments are quite long in terms of line count "
"(items in [libstd](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd) "
"are a good example of this). Doc comments document behavior of functions, "
"structs, and types to the end user, they do not explain for a coder working "
"on the library as to how they work internally. When actually writing code "
"for a library the doc comments end up cluttering the source code making it "
"harder to find relevant lines to change or skim through and read what is "
"going on."

"Localization is something else that would further open up access to the "
"community. By providing docs in different languages we could significantly "

"is not their first language. This would be made possible with a config flag "
"choosing what file to import as a doc comment."

"`#[doc(include = \"file_path\")]` is an extension of the current `#[doc = "
"\"doc\"]` attribute by allowing documentation to exist outside of the source "
"code. This isn't entirely hard to grasp if one is familiar with attributes "
"but if not then this syntax vs a `///` or `//!` type of comment could cause "
"confusion. By labeling the attribute as `external_doc`, having a clear path "
"and type (either `line` or `mod`) then should, at the very least, provide "
"context as to what's going on and where to find this file for inclusion."

"The acceptance of this proposal would minimally impact all levels of Rust "
