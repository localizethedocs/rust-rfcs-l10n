msgid ""
"The current Rust style, as defined in the Rust Style Guide and as "
"implemented by rustfmt, has some stability expectations associated with it. "
"In particular, many projects implement continuous integration hooks that "
"verify the style of Rust code (such as with `cargo fmt --check`), and "
"changes to the style would break the CI of such projects, in addition to "
"causing churn."

"This document proposes to evolve the current Rust style, without breaking "
"backwards compatibility, by tying style evolution to Rust edition. Code in "
"Rust 2015, 2018, or 2021 will use the existing default style. Code in future "
"editions (Rust 2024 and onwards) may use a new style edition."

"This RFC only defines the mechanism by which we evolve the Rust style; this "
"RFC does _not_ define any specific style changes. Future RFCs or style-guide "
"PRs will define future style editions. This RFC does not propose or define "
"any specific future style editions or other formatting changes."

msgid ""
"`rustfmt`, and `cargo fmt`, will format code according to the default Rust "
"style. The default Rust style varies by Rust edition. (Not every edition "
"changes the Rust style, and thus some editions have identical default "
"styles; Rust 2015, 2018, and 2021 all have the same default style.)"
msgstr ""

#: src/3338-style-evolution.md:39
msgid ""
"Direct invocations of `rustfmt` obtain the edition used for parsing Rust "
"code from the `edition` option in its configuration file (`rustfmt.toml` or "
"`.rustfmt.toml`), or via the `--edition` command-line option; `cargo fmt` "
"obtains the edition from the `edition` option in `Cargo.toml` and passes it "
"to `rustfmt`. By default, `rustfmt` and `cargo fmt` will use the same "
"edition for style as the Rust edition used for parsing."
msgstr ""

#: src/3338-style-evolution.md:46
msgid ""
"However, when transitioning between editions, projects may want to "
"separately make and commit the changes for 1) transitioning to a new Rust "
"edition and 2) transitioning to a new style edition. Keeping formatting "
"changes in a separate commit also helps tooling ignore that commit, such as "
"with git's `blame.ignoreRevsFile`."
msgstr ""

#: src/3338-style-evolution.md:52
msgid ""
"To allow for this, `rustfmt` also allows configuring the style edition "
"directly, via a separate `style_edition` configuration option, or `--style-"
"edition` command-line option. `style_edition` or `--style-edition`, if set, "
"always overrides `edition` or `--edition` for the purposes of styling, "
"though `edition` or `--edition` still determines the edition for the "
"purposes of parsing Rust code."
msgstr ""

#: src/3338-style-evolution.md:59
msgid ""
"Note that rustfmt may not necessarily support all combinations of Rust "
"edition and style edition; in particular, it may not support using a style "
"edition that differs by more than one step from the Rust edition. Similarly, "
"rustfmt need not support every existing configuration option in new style "
"editions."

"New style editions will be initially introduced as nightly-only, to make "
"them available for testing; such nightly-only editions will produce an error "
"if requested in stable rustfmt. Nightly versions of style editions are "
"subject to change and do not provide stability guarantees. New style "
"editions will get stabilized contemporaneously with the corresponding Rust "
"edition."

"The current version of the style guide will describe the latest Rust "
"edition. Each distinct past style will have a corresponding archived version "
"of the style guide. Note that archived versions of the style guide may not "
"necessarily document formatting for newer Rust constructs that did not exist "
"at the time that version of the style guide was archived. However, each "
"style edition will still format all constructs valid in that Rust edition, "
"with the style of those constructs coming from the first subsequent style "
"edition providing formatting rules for that construct."

msgid ""
"We could have a completely separate configuration mechanism, unrelated to "
"editions. This would increase the development and testing burden of rustfmt, "
"and seems unlikely to provide commensurate value. This would also increase "
"the complexity for end users, who would have to understand two separate "
"mechanisms for handling forwards-compatibility and wonder how they differ. "
"We feel that since we're providing a mechanism similar to editions, we "
"should make it clear to users that it works like editions."
msgstr ""

#: src/3338-style-evolution.md:90
msgid ""
"We could allow style edition to vary completely independently of Rust "
"edition. This would, for instance, allow projects to stay on old style "
"editions indefinitely. However, this would substantially increase the "
"development and testing burden for formatting tooling, and require more "
"complex decisions about how old style editions format constructs that didn't "
"exist in the corresponding Rust edition. In general, while the Rust edition "
"mechanism allows projects to stay on old Rust editions, and projects doing "
"so can similarly stay on the corresponding old style editions, the style "
"edition mechanism does not exist to facilitate staying on old styles "
"_indefinitely_ while still moving forward to newer Rust editions."
msgstr ""

#: src/3338-style-evolution.md:101
msgid ""
"We could leave out the separate configuration of style edition, and keep "
"style edition in lockstep with Rust edition. This would be easier to develop "
"and test, but would mean larger and noisier commits in projects "
