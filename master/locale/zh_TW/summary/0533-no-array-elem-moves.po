msgid ""
"If we want to continue supporting dynamic drop while also removing automatic "
"memory zeroing and drop-flags, then we need to either (1.) adopt potential "
"complex code generation strategies to support arrays with only _some_ "
"elements initialized (as discussed in the [unresolved questions for RFC PR "
"320](https://github.com/pnkfelix/rfcs/"
"blob/6288739c584ee6830aa0f79f983c5e762269c562/active/0000-nonzeroing-dynamic-"
"drop.md#how-to-handle-moves-out-of-arrayindex_expr), or we need to (2.) "
"remove support for constructing such arrays in safe code."

"The expectation is that relatively few libraries need to support moving out "
"of fixed-sized arrays (and even fewer take advantage of being able to "
"initialize individual elements of an uninitialized array, as supporting this "
"was almost certainly not intentional in the language design). Therefore "
"removing the feature from the language will present relatively little burden."

"If an expression `e` has type `[T; n]` and `T` does not implement `Copy`, "

"If an expression `e` has type `[T; n]` expression `e[i] = <expr>` will be "

"initialized."

#: src/0533-no-array-elem-moves.md:46
msgid ""
"Note that it _remains_ legal to overwrite an element in an initialized "
"array: `e[i] = <expr>`, as today.  This will continue to drop the "
"overwritten element before moving the result of `<expr>` into place."

"Note also that the proposed change has no effect on the semantics of "
