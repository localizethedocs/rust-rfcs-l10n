"Support defining C-compatible variadic functions in Rust, via new "
"intrinsics. Rust currently supports declaring external variadic functions "
"and calling them from unsafe code, but does not support writing such "
"functions directly in Rust. Adding such support will allow Rust to replace a "
"larger variety of C libraries, avoid requiring C stubs and error-prone "
"reimplementation of platform-specific code, improve incremental translation "
"of C codebases to Rust, and allow implementation of variadic callbacks."

msgstr ""

#: src/2137-variadic.md:20
msgid ""
"Rust can currently call any possible C interface, and export _almost_ any "
"interface for C to call. Variadic functions represent one of the last "
"remaining gaps in the latter. Currently, providing a variadic function "
"callable from C requires writing a stub function in C, linking that function "
"into the Rust program, and arranging for that stub to subsequently call into "
"Rust. Furthermore, even with the arguments packaged into a `va_list` "
"structure by C code, extracting arguments from that structure requires "
"exceptionally error-prone, platform-specific code, for which the crates.io "
"ecosystem provides only partial solutions for a few target architectures."

"This RFC does not propose an interface intended for native Rust code to pass "
"variable numbers of arguments to a native Rust function, nor an interface "
"that provides any kind of type safety. This proposal exists primarily to "
"allow Rust to provide interfaces callable from C code."

"intrinsics. The LLVM intrinsics only support using the ABI of the containing "

"supporting the native `\"C\"` ABI for now. Doing so will not prevent the "
