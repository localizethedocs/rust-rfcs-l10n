"Rust has a string concatenation method named `.connect()` in "
"`SliceConcatExt`. However, this does not align with the precedents in other "
"languages. Most languages use `.join()` for that purpose, as seen later."

"This is probably because, in the ancient Rust, `join` was a keyword to join "
"a task. However, `join` retired as a keyword in 2011 with the commit rust-"
"lang/rust@d1857d3. While `.connect()` is technically correct, the name may "
"not be directly inferred by the users of the mainstream languages. There was "
