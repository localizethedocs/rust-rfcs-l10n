"Currently, the interface for `std::net::Ipv6Addr` is oriented around 16-bit "
"\"segments\".  The constructor takes eight 16-bit integers as arguments, and "
"the sole getter function, `segments`, returns an array of eight 16-bit "
"integers.  This interface is unnatural when doing low-level network "
"programming, where IPv6 addresses are treated as a sequence of 16 octets. "
"For example, building and parsing IPv6 packets requires doing bitwise "
"arithmetic with careful attention to byte order in order to convert between "
"the on-wire format of 16 octets and the eight segments format used by `std::"
"net::Ipv6Addr`."

"Do nothing.  The downside is that developers will need to resort to bitwise "
"arithmetic, which is awkward and error-prone (particularly with respect to "
"byte ordering) to convert between `Ipv6Addr` and the on-wire representation "
"of IPv6 addresses.  Or they will use their alternative implementations of "
"`Ipv6Addr`, fragmenting the ecosystem."
