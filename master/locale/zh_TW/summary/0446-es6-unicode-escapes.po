"The syntax of `\\u` followed by four hexadecimal digits dates from when "
"Unicode was a 16-bit encoding, and only went up to U+FFFF. `\\U` followed by "
"eight hex digits was added as a band-aid when Unicode was extended to "
"U+10FFFF, but neither four nor eight digits particularly make sense now."

"Having two different syntaxes with the same meaning but that apply to "

"Formatting templates already use curly braces. Having multiple curly braces "
