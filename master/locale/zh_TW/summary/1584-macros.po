"There are several changes to the declarative macro system which are "
"desirable but not backwards compatible (See [RFC 1561](https://github.com/"
"rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1561) for some changes to macro naming and "
"modularisation, I would also like to propose improvements to hygiene in "
"macros, and some improved syntax)."

"In order to maintain Rust's backwards compatibility guarantees, we cannot "
"change the existing system (`macro_rules!`) to accommodate these changes. I "

"I believe it is extremely important that moving to the new macro system is "
"as straightforward as possible for both macro users and authors. This must "
"be the case so that users make the transition to the new system and we are "
"not left with two systems forever."
msgstr ""

#: src/1584-macros.md:84
msgid ""
"A goal of this design is that for macro users, there is no difference in "
"using the two systems other than how macros are named. For macro authors, "
"most macros that work in the old system should work in the new system with "
"minimal changes. Macros which will need some adjustment are those that "
"exploit holes in the current hygiene system."

"A declarative macro is declared using the `macro` keyword. For example, "

"Throughout this RFC, I use 'declarative macro' to refer to a macro declared "
"using declarative (and domain specific) syntax (such as the current "
"`macro_rules!` syntax). The 'declarative macros' name is in opposition to "
"'procedural macros', which are declared as Rust programs. The specific "
"declarative syntax using pattern matching and templating is often referred "
"to as 'macros by example'."

msgid ""
"There is a risk that `macro_rules!` is good enough for most users and there "
"is low adoption of the new system. Possibly worse would be that there is "
"high adoption but little migration from the old system, leading to us having "
"to support two systems forever."

"Make backwards incompatible changes to `macro_rules!`. This is probably a "

"What to do with `macro_rules`? We will need to maintain it at least until "
"`macro` is stable. Hopefully, we can then deprecate it (some time will be "

"remove `macro_rules!`. That will take a long time, and would require a 2.0 "
"version of Rust to strictly adhere to our stability guarantees."
