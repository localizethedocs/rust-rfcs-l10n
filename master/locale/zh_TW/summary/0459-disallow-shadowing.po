"Today we allow type and lifetime parameters to be shadowed. This is a common "

"case is:"

"In this example, the lifetime parameter `'a` is shadowed on the method, "
"leading to two logically distinct lifetime parameters with the same name. "
"This then leads to the error message:"

"We could use a lint instead. However, we'd want to ensure that the lint "
"error messages were printed _before_ type-checking begins. We could do this, "
"perhaps, by running the lint printing pass multiple times. This might be "
"useful in any case as the placement of lints in the compiler pipeline has "
"proven problematic before."

"We could also attempt to improve the error messages. Doing so for lifetimes "
"is definitely important in any case, but also somewhat tricky due to the "
"extensive inference. It is usually easier and more reliable to help avoid "
"the error in the first place."
