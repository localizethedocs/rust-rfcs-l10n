msgid ""
"There is a need to decide on detailed guidelines for the format of Rust "

"These discussions should happen in the open and be highly visible. It is "

"exists to satisfy these goals, and is tried and tested. However, the "
"discussion is likely to be a high-bandwidth one (code style is a contentious "
"and often subjective topic, and syntactic RFCs tend to be the highest "
"traffic ones). Therefore, having the discussion on the RFCs repository could "
"easily overwhelm it and make it less useful for other important discussions."
