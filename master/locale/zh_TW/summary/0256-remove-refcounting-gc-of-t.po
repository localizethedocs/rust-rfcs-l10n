msgid ""
"Long ago, the Rust language had integrated support for automatically managed "
"memory with arbitrary graph structure (notably, multiple references to the "
"same object), via the type constructors `@T` and `@mut T` for any `T`.  The "
"intention was that Rust would provide a task-local garbage collector as part "
"of the standard runtime for Rust programs."
msgstr ""

#: src/0256-remove-refcounting-gc-of-t.md:25
msgid ""
"As a short-term convenience, `@T` and `@mut T` were implemented via "
"reference-counting: each instance of `@T`/`@mut T` had a reference count "
"added to it (as well as other meta-data that were again for implementation "
"convenience).  To support this, the `rustc` compiler would emit, for any "
"instruction copying or overwriting an instance of `@T`/`@mut T`, code to "
"update the reference count(s) accordingly."
msgstr ""

#: src/0256-remove-refcounting-gc-of-t.md:32
msgid ""
"(At the same time, `@T` was still considered an instance of `Copy` by the "
"compiler.  Maintaining the reference counts of `@T` means that you _cannot_ "
"create copies of a given type implementing `Copy` by `memcpy`'ing blindly; "
"one must distinguish so-called \"POD\" data that is `Copy and contains no "
"`@T`from \"non-POD\"`Copy`data that can contain`@T\\` and thus must be sure "
"to update reference counts when creating a copy.)"
msgstr ""

#: src/0256-remove-refcounting-gc-of-t.md:40
msgid ""
"Over time, `@T` was replaced with the library type `Gc<T>` (and `@mut T` was "
"rewritten as `Gc<RefCell<T>>`), but the intention was that Rust would still "
"have integrated support for a garbage collection.  To continue supporting "
"the reference-count updating semantics, the `Gc<T>` type has a lang item, "
"`\"gc\"`.  In effect, all of the compiler support for maintaining the "
"reference-counts from the prior `@T` was still in place; the move to a "
"library type `Gc<T>` was just a shift in perspective from the end-user's "
"point of view (and that of the parser)."

"Then remove the `rustc` support for `Gc<T>`. As part of this, we can either "

"As another related note, it may confuse people to take out a `Gc<T>` type "

"Keep the `Gc<T>` implementation that we have today, and wait until we have a "
"tracing GC implemented and ready to be deployed before removing the "
"reference-counting infrastructure that had been put in to support `@T`.  "
"(Which may never happen, since adding a tracing GC is only a goal, not a "
"certainty, and thus we may be stuck supporting the reference-counting "
"`Gc<T>` until we eventually do decide to remove `Gc<T>` in the future.  So "
