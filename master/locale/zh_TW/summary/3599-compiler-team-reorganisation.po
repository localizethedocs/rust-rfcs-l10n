"Compiler team contributors were introduced [in 2019 with RFC 2689](https://"

"Furthermore, the day-to-day operations of the team are composed of more "

"As the team gets larger, our processes need to remain efficient. Final "

"Processes which scale poorly with team size have acted as a unconscious "

"In this RFC's proposal, it is expected that activites are shared amongst a "
"group of team members, and that team members do less of other activities so "
"that their workload is sustainable, but this isn't enforced. Team leads are "
"instead responsible for ensuring that the team is large enough to perform "
"each activity sustainably."
