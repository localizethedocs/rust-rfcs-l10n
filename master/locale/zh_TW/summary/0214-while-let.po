"Just as `if let` was inspired by Swift, it turns out Swift supports `while "
"let` as well. This was not discovered until much too late to include it in "
"the `if let` RFC. It turns out that this sort of looping is actually useful "
"on occasion. For example, the desugaring `for` loop is actually a variant on "
"this; if `while let` existed it could have been implemented to map `for PAT "
"in EXPR { BODY }` to"

"This also makes the language a bit more consistent; right now, any condition "
"that can be used with `if` can be used with `while`. The new `if let` adds a "
"form of `if` that doesn't map to `while`. Supporting `while let` restores "
"the equivalence of these two control-flow constructs."

"Just as with `if let`, an irrefutable pattern given to `while let` is "
"considered an error. This is largely an artifact of the fact that the "
"desugared `match` ends up with an unreachable pattern, and is not actually a "
"goal of this syntax. The error may be suppressed in the future, which would "
"be a backwards-compatible change."

"`while let` could be extended to support alternative patterns, just as match "
"arms do. This is not part of the main proposal for the same reason it was "
"left out of `if let`, which is that a) it looks weird, and b) it's a bit of "
"an odd coupling with the `let` keyword as alternatives like this aren't "
"going to be introducing variable bindings. However, it would make `while "
"let` more general and able to replace more instances of `loop { match "
"{ ... } }` than is possible with the main design."
