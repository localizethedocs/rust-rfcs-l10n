msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:13
msgid ""
"In ancient Rust, one of the primary methods of printing a value was via the "
"`%?` format specifier. This would use reflection at runtime to determine how "
"to print a type. Metadata generated by the compiler (a `TyDesc`) would be "
"generated to guide the runtime in how to print a type. One of the great "
"parts about reflection was that it was quite easy to print any type. No "
"extra burden was required from the programmer to print something."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:20
msgid "There are, however, a number of cons to this approach:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:22
msgid ""
"Generating extra metadata for many many types by the compiler can lead to "
"noticeable increases in compile time and binary size."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:24
msgid ""
"This form of formatting is inherently not speedy. Widespread usage of `%?` "
"led to misleading benchmarks about formatting in Rust."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:26
msgid ""
"Depending on how metadata is handled, this scheme makes it very difficult to "
"allow recompiling a library without recompiling downstream dependants."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:29
msgid ""
"Over time, usage off the `?` formatting has fallen out of fashion for the "
"following reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:32
msgid ""
"The `deriving`\\-based infrastructure was improved greatly and has started "
"seeing much more widespread use, especially for traits like `Clone`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:34
msgid ""
"The formatting language implementation and syntax has changed. The most "
"common formatter is now `{}` (an implementation of `Show`), and it is quite "
"common to see an implementation of `Show` on nearly all types (frequently "
"via `deriving`). This form of customizable-per-typformatting largely "
"provides the gap that the original formatting language did not provide, "
"which was limited to only primitives and `%?`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:40
msgid ""
"Compiler built-ins, such as `~[T]` and `~str` have been removed from the "
"language, and runtime reflection on `Vec<T>` and `String` are far less "
"useful (they just print pointers, not contents)."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:44
msgid ""
"As a result, the `:?` formatting specifier is quite rarely used today, and "
"when it _is_ used it's largely for historical purposes and the output is not "
"of very high quality any more."
msgstr ""

"The drawbacks and today's current state of affairs motivate this RFC to "

"was created."

msgid ""
"The current infrastructure for reflection, although outdated, represents a "
"significant investment of work in the past which could be a shame to lose. "
"While present in the git history, this infrastructure has been updated over "
"time, and it will no longer receive this attention."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:74
msgid ""
"Additionally, given an arbitrary type `T`, it would now be impossible to "
"print it in literally any situation. Type parameters will now require some "
"bound, such as `Show`, to allow printing a type."
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:78
msgid ""
"These two drawbacks are currently not seen as large enough to outweigh the "
"gains from reducing the surface area of the `std::fmt` API and reduction in "
"maintenance load on the compiler."

msgid "Alternatives"
msgstr ""

#: src/0379-remove-reflection.md:84
msgid ""
"The primary alternative to outright removing this infrastructure is to "
"preserve it, but flag it all as `#[experimental]` or feature-gated. The "
"compiler could require the `fmt_poly` feature gate to be enabled to enable "
"formatting via `:?` in a crate. This would mean that any backwards-"
"incompatible changes could continue to be made, and any arbitrary type `T` "
"could still be printed."
