#: src/3309-style-team.md:14
msgid ""
"RFC 1607 proposed and motivated a process for determining code formatting "
"guidelines and producing a style guide, via a temporary style team. That "
"style guide was published as RFC 2436, and the style team wound up its "
"operation and no longer exists. However, Rust has multiple ongoing needs for "
"new determinations regarding Rust style, such as determining the style of "
"new Rust constructs, and evolving the Rust style over time. Thus, this RFC "
"re-charters the Rust Style Team as a non-temporary subteam."

msgid ""
"The renewed need for the Rust style team began to arise in discussions of "
"language constructs such as `let`\\-chaining (RFC 2497) and `let`\\-`else` "
"(RFC 3137). New constructs like these, by default, get ignored and not "
"formatted by rustfmt, and subsequently need formatting added. The rustfmt "
"team has expressed a preference to not make style determinations itself; the "
"rustfmt team would prefer to implement style determinations made by another "
"team."
msgstr ""

#: src/3309-style-team.md:21
msgid ""
"In addition, rustfmt maintains backwards compatibility guarantees: code that "
"has been correctly formatted with rustfmt won't get formatted differently "
"with a future version of rustfmt. This avoids churn, and avoids creating CI "
"failures when people use rustfmt to check style in CI. However, this also "
"prevents evolving the Rust style to take community desires into account and "
"improve formatting over time. rustfmt provides various configuration options "
"to change its default formatting, and many of those options represent "
"changes that many people in the community would like enabled by default."

"the purview of the rustfmt team. The style team may also provide non-binding "
"advice to the language team on aspects of proposed Rust language constructs "
