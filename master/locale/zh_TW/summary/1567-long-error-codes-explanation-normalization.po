"Rust has extend error messages that explain each error in more detail. We've "
"been writing lots of them, which is good, but they're written in different "
"styles, which is bad. This RFC intends to fix this inconsistency by "
"providing a template for these long-form explanations to follow."

"Long error codes explanations are a very important part of Rust. Having an "
"explanation of what failed helps to understand the error and is appreciated "
"by Rust developers of all skill levels. Providing an unified template is "
"needed in order to help people who would want to write ones as well as "
"people who read them."
