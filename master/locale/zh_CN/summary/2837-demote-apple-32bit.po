"Apple [publicly announced](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436) that "
"macOS 10.14 Mojave is the last OS supporting the execution of 32bit "
"binaries, and macOS 10.15 (and later) prevents running them at all. It's "
"been years since the last 32bit Apple hardware was sold, so providing 64bit "
"binaries should cover most of the macOS userbase."

"Apple [also announced](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/"
"app_and_environment/updating_your_app_from_32-bit_to_64-bit_architecture) "
"that iOS 10 is the last one supporting the execution of 32bit apps, and they "
"won't work at all on iOS 11 and later. All iPhones after the iPhone 5 and "
"the iPhone 5C support 64bit apps, which means all the supported ones can run "

"Along with the deprecation, Apple removed support for building 32bit "
