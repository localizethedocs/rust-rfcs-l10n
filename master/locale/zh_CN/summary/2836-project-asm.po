"To create a [project group](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/"

"designing subsequent RFCs to extend the language to support inline assembly "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2836-project-asm.md:14
msgid ""
"In systems programming some tasks require dropping down to the assembly "
"level. The primary reasons are for performance, precise timing, and low "
"level hardware access. Using inline assembly for this is sometimes "
"convenient, and sometimes necessary to avoid function call overhead."

#: src/2836-project-asm.md:16
msgid ""
"The inline assembler syntax currently available in nightly Rust is very ad-"
"hoc. It provides a thin wrapper over the inline assembly syntax available in "
"LLVM IR. For stabilization a more user-friendly syntax that lends itself to "
"implementation across various backends is preferable."
