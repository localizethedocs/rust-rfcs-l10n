"Make the `assert!` macro recognize more expressions (utilizing the power of "
"procedural macros), and extend the readability of debug dumps."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2011-generic-assert.md:14
msgid ""
"While clippy warns about `assert!` usage that should be replaced by "
"`assert_eq!`, it's quite annoying to migrate around."

"We're going to parse AST and break up them by operators (excluding `.` (dot, "
"member access operator)). Function calls and bracket surrounded blocks are "
"considered as one block and don't get expanded. The exact expanding rules "
"should be determined when implemented, but an example is provided for "
"reference."

"On assertion failure, the expression itself is stringified, and another line "
"with intermediate values are printed out. The values should be printed with "
"`Debug`, and a plain text fallback if the following conditions fail:"

"the operator is non-comparison (those in `std::ops`) and the type (may also "
"be a reference) doesn't implement `Copy`."
msgstr ""

#: src/2011-generic-assert.md:27

"To make sure that there's no side effects involved (e.g. running `next()` "
"twice on `Iterator`), each value should be stored as temporaries and dumped "
"on assertion failure."

"This has a potential performance degradation on complex expressions, due to "
