msgid "Motivation"

msgid "Each trait has a distinct motivation:"

#: src/1030-prelude-additions.md:14
msgid ""
"For `Default`, the ergonomics have vastly improved now that you can write "
"`MyType::default()` (thanks to UFCS). Thanks to this improvement, it now "
"makes more sense to promote widespread use of the trait."
msgstr ""

#: src/1030-prelude-additions.md:19
msgid ""
"For `IntoIterator`, promoting to the prelude will make it feasible to "
"deprecate the inherent `into_iter` methods and directly-exported iterator "
"types, in favor of the trait (which is currently redundant)."
msgstr ""

#: src/1030-prelude-additions.md:23
msgid ""
"For `ToOwned`, promoting to the prelude would add a uniform, idiomatic way "
"to acquire an owned copy of data (including going from `str` to `String`, "
"for which `Clone` does not work)."

"Ultimately deprecate module-level `IntoIter` types (e.g. in `vec`); this may "
"want to wait until you can write `Vec<T>::IntoIter` rather than `<Vec<T> as "
"IntoIterator>::IntoIter`."

msgid "Drawbacks"
msgstr ""

#: src/1030-prelude-additions.md:39
msgid ""
"The main downside is that prelude entries eat up some amount of namespace "
"(particularly, method namespace). However, these are all important, core "
"traits in `std`, meaning that the method names are already quite unlikely to "
"be used."

"Strictly speaking, a prelude addition is a breaking change, but as above, "
"this is highly unlikely to cause actual breakage. In any case, it can be "
"landed prior to 1.0."
