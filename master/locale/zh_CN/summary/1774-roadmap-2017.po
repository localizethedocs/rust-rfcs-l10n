"Rust has taken a decidedly lean approach to its standard library, preferring "
"for much of the typical \"batteries included\" functionality to live "
"externally in the crates.io ecosystem. While there are a lot of benefits to "
"that approach, it's important that we do in fact provide the batteries "
"somewhere: we need 1.0-level functionality for essential tasks. To pick just "
"one example, the `rand` crate has suffered from a lack of vision and has "
"effectively stalled before reaching 1.0 maturity, despite its central "
"importance for a non-trivial part of the ecosystem."

"The first is to identify a broad set of \"essential tasks\" by, for example, "

"libraries, and focus community efforts on bolstering crates in these areas. "
"With sustained and systematic effort, we can probably help push a number of "
"these crates to 1.0 maturity this year."
msgstr ""

#: src/1774-roadmap-2017.md:369

"A second strategy is to focus specifically on tasks that play to Rust's "
"strengths. For example, Rust's potential for [fearless concurrency](http://"
"blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html) across a range of "
"paradigms is one of the most unique and exciting aspects of the language. "
"But we aren't fully delivering on this potential, due to the immaturity of "
"libraries in the space. The response to work in this space, like the recent "
"[futures library announcement](http://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/"
"futures/), suggests that there is a lot of pent-up demand and excitement, "
"and that this kind of work can open a lot of doors for Rust. So concurrency/"
"asynchrony/parallelism is one segment of the ecosystem that likely deserves "
"particular focus (and feeds into the high-scale server goal as well); there "
"are likely others."

"When working with larger organizations interested in using Rust, one of the "

"ecosystem. Part of the issue seems to be a perceived overlap between "
"functionality in Cargo (and its notion of compilation unit) and in ambient "
