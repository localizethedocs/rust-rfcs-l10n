#: src/2420-unreserve-proc.md:14
msgid ""
"We are currently not using `proc` as a keyword for anything in the language. "
"Currently, `proc` is a reserved keyword for future use. However, we have no "
"intention of using the keyword for anything in the future, and as such, we "
"want to unreserve it so that rustaceans can use it as identifiers."

"In the specific case of `proc`, it is a useful identifier for many things. "
"In particular, it is useful when dealing with processes, OS internals and "
"kernel development."

"The keyword `proc` could be used for some [`Arrow` notation](https://"
"downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.1/docs/html/users_guide/arrow-notation.html) "
"as used in Haskell. However, `proc` notation is rarely used in Haskell since "
"`Arrow`s are not generally understood; and if something is not well "
"understood by one of the most academically inclined of communities of users, "
"it is doubly a bad fit for Rust which has a community mixed with users used "
"to FP, systemsy and dynamically checked programming languages. Moreover, "
"`Arrow`s would most likely require HKTs which we might not get."
