"Functions and re-exports of functions usually behave the same way, but they "

"The `#[main]` attribute can also be used to change the entry point of the "
"generated binary. This is largely irrelevant for this RFC as this RFC tries "
"to fix an inconsistency with re-exports and directly defined functions. "
"Nevertheless, it can be pointed out that the `#[main]` attribute does not "
"cover all the above-mentioned use cases."
