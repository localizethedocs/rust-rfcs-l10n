msgid ""
"Allows macros which operate on methods to do more, more easily without "
"having to rebuild the concrete self type. Macros could use the literal self "
"type like programmers do, but that requires extra machinery in the macro "
"expansion code and extra work by the macro author."

"Allows easier copy and pasting of method signatures from trait declarations "

"I'm hitting the macro problem in a side project. I wrote and hope to land "
"the compiler code to make it work, but it is ugly and this is a much nicer "
"solution. It is also really easy to implement, and since it is just a "
"desugaring, it should not add any additional complexity to the compiler. "
"Obviously, this should not block 1.0."

"When used inside an impl, `Self` is desugared during syntactic expansion to "
"the concrete type being implemented. `Self` can be used anywhere the "

"We could just force authors to use the concrete type as we do currently. "
"This would require macro expansion code to make available the concrete type "
"(or the whole impl AST) to macros working on methods. The macro author would "
"then extract/construct the self type and use it instead of `Self`."
