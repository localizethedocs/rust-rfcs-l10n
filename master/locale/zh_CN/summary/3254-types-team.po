"The types team is meant to build a base of maintainers for the formal side "
"of Rust, both design and implementation. This has traditionally been an area "
"with a very low \"[bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)\", "
"both in terms of the compiler (few maintainers to the code) and the language "
"design (few people who fully understand the entire space). This has led to a "
"general paralysis in which new features (implied bounds, const generics, "
"specialization, etc) are stalled for long periods of time due to a "
"combination of an inflexible implementation, a lack of maintainers, and a "
"general difficulty in reasoning about their interactions."

"The original RFC for where clauses included equality constraints like `where "
"T == U` (tracked by [\\#20041](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"
"issues/20041)); similarly, people have regularly considered including the "
"option to have \"negated\" where clauses like `where T: !Debug`. Both of "
"these features, if led to their full generality, turn out to make the "
"implementation of Rust's trait solver significantly more complicated. "
"Therefore, the types team is within its rights to veto these features or to "
"suggest appropriate modifications to how they work and what they mean. On "
"the other hand, it is up to the lang team to decide the syntax of those "
"where clauses and whether they'd be a useful addition to Rust (presuming "
"they had a semantics the types team was happy with). The types team cannot "
"add a feature to Rust all by itself, but it can either remove one (because "
"it is not feasible to implement) or tweak its formal semantics (to ensure it "
"is sound, feasible etc). In this respect, it is just like the compiler team. "
"Of course, this would and should be done with the full spirit of "
"collaboration between teams that the Rust Project today already employs. "
"Decisions are not made in a vacuum. Ultimately, the types team exists as a "
"chunk of the middle-ground between the lang and compiler teams that involves "
"the Rust type system, and by creating this team, both the lang and compiler "
"teams give the types team the authority to work through that chunk of "
