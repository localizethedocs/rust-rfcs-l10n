"According to current documents, the RFC process is required to make "
"\"substantial\" changes to the Rust distribution. It is currently "
"lightweight, but lacks a definition for the Rust distribution. This RFC aims "
"to amend the process with a both broad and clear definition of \"Rust "
"distribution,\" while still keeping the process itself in tact."

#: src/0531-define-rfc-scope.md:14
msgid ""
"The motivation for this change comes from the recent decision for Crates.io "
"to affirm its first come, first serve policy. While there was discussion of "
"the matter on a GitHub issue, this discussion was rather low visibility. "
"Regardless of the outcome of this particular decision, it highlights the "
"fact that there is not a clear place for thorough discussion of policy "
"decisions related to the outermost parts of Rust."

"To remedy this issue, there must be a defined scope for the RFC process. "
"This definition would be incorporated into the section titled \"When you "
"need to follow this process.\" The goal here is to be as explicit as "
"possible. This RFC proposes that the scope of the RFC process be defined as "
"follows:"

"The only particular drawback would be if this definition is too narrow, it "

"The alternative is leaving the process as is. However, adding clarity at "
"little to no cost should be preferred as it lowers the barrier to entry for "
"contributions, and increases the visibility of potential changes that may "
"have previously been discussed outside of an RFC."
