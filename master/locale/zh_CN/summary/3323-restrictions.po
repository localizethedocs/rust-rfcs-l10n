"Currently, a trait being visible (and nameable) in a given location implies "

"public trait in a private or restricted module."

"Similarly, a field being visible currently implies that you are able to "

"on the value of other fields, for example. This means that making fields "
"public, while acceptable for read access, is not acceptable for write "
"access. Limiting the ability to mutate a field to a certain scope is "

"**Restrictions** limit what you are allowed to do with a type. In this "
