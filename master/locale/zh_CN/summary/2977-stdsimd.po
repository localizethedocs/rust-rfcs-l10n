"This RFC establishes a new project group, under the libs team, to produce a "
"portable SIMD API in a new `rust-lang/stdsimd` repository, exposed through a "
"new `std::simd` (and `core::simd`) module in the standard library in the "
"same manner as [`stdarch`](https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch). The output "
"of this project group will be the finalization of [RFC 2948](https://github."
"com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2948) and stabilization of `std::simd`."

#: src/2977-stdsimd.md:16
msgid ""
"The current stable `core::arch` module is described by [RFC 2325](https://"
"rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2325-stable-simd.html), which considers a portable "
"API desirable but out-of-scope. The current [RFC 2948](https://github.com/"
"rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2948) provides a good motivation for this API. Various "
"ecosystem implementations of portable SIMD have appeared over the years, "
"including [`packed_simd`](https://github.com/rust-lang/packed_simd), and "
"[`wide`](https://github.com/Lokathor/wide), each taking a different set of "
"trade-offs in implementation while retaining some similarities in their "
"public API. The group will pull together a \"blessed\" implementation in the "
"standard library with the explicit goal of stabilization for the [2021 "
"edition](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2966)."
