msgid ""
"The \"RFC\" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a "
"consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the language and "
"standard libraries, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the "
"direction the language is evolving in."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0002-rfc-process.md:14
msgid ""
"The freewheeling way that we add new features to Rust has been good for "
"early development, but for Rust to become a mature platform we need to "
"develop some more self-discipline when it comes to changing the system. This "
"is a proposal for a more principled RFC process to make it a more integral "
"part of the overall development process, and one that is followed "
"consistently to introduce features to Rust."

"In short, to get a major feature added to Rust, one must first get the RFC "
