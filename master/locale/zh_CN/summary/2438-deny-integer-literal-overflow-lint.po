msgid ""
"Rust has a strong focus on providing compile-time protection against common "
"programmer errors. In early versions of Rust (circa 2012), integer literals "
"were statically prevented from exceeding the range of their underlying fixed-"
"size integral type. This was enforced syntactically, as at the time all "
"integer literals required a suffix to denote their intended type, e.g. `let "
"x: u8 = 0u8;`, so the parser itself was capable of rejecting e.g. `let x = "
"256u8;`. Eventually [integer literal type inference](https://mail.mozilla."
"org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-July/002002.html) was implemented to improve "
"ergonomics, allowing `let x: u8 = 0;`, but the property that the parser "
"could enforce integer range checking [was lost](https://mail.mozilla.org/"
"pipermail/rust-dev/2012-December/002734.html). It was [re-added](https://"
"github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/4220) as a warn-by-default lint for the "
"following reasons:"

"Neither I nor anyone else that I have polled can come up with any useful "
"purpose for allowing integer literals to overflow. The only potential "
"objection that has been raised is that we _wouldn't_ catch something like "
"`let x: u8 = 255 + 1;`, but that doesn't change the fact that denying "
"integer literals from overflow would prevent strictly more bugs than Rust "
"does today, at no additional cost."

"One further note: our intent here is primarily to deny overflowing integer "
"literals, though the `overflowing_literals` lint has one other function: to "
"warn when a floating-point literal exceeds the largest or smallest finite "
"number that is representable by the chosen precision. However, this isn't "
"\"overflow\" per se, because in this case Rust will assign the value of "
"positive or negative infinity to the variable in question. Because this "
"wouldn't clash with our general stance against implicit overflow, it would "
"not be inconsistent to continue allowing this; however, we adopt the stance "
"that it is both desirable to force someone who wants a value of infinity to "
"explicitly use e.g. `std::f32::INFINITY`, and that it is unlikely that code "
"in the wild would break because of this (and any potential breakage would be "
"precisely noted by the compiler, and could be fixed quickly and trivially). "
"Therefore we are content with the additional strictness that denying this "
"lint would imply."

"Integer literals may not exceed the numeric upper or lower bounds of the "
"underlying integral type. For example, for the unsigned eight-bit integer "
"type `u8`, the lowest number it can represent is 0 and the highest number is "
"255; therefore an assignment such as `let x: u8 = -1;` or `let x: u8 = 256;` "
"will be rejected by the compiler."

"Floating-point literals may not exceed the largest or smallest finite number "

"as `let x: f32 = 3.5e38;`, it will be rejected by the compiler."

"To document what is already implemented: any assignment operation that would "
"result in an integral type being assigned a literal value that is outside of "
"that integral type's range will be rejected by the compiler. This "
"encompasses straightforward assignment: `let x: u8 = 256;`; as well as "
"transitive assignment: `let x = 256; let y: u8 = x;`; as well as function "
"calls: `fn foo(x: u8){} foo(256)`. This does not encompass arithmetic "
"operations that would result in arithmetic overflow; `let x: u8 = 255 + 1;` "

"An alternative to this proposal would be to deny the ability to write "
"overflowing integer literals while still allowing one to write overlarge "
"floating-point literals. This would involve splitting the "
"`overflowing_literals` lint into two separate lints, one for ints and one "
"for floats, and denying only the former."

"Another alternative would be to turn these warnings into hard errors rather "
"than merely denying them; the difference being that in this case nobody "
"would be able to re-enable this behavior. The use case that would suffer "
"from this would be automatic code generation from C programs that make use "
"of C's implicit literal overflow; transition for these users would be easier "
"if this was not a hard error and thus `#![allow(overflowing_literals)]` "
"would suffice."
