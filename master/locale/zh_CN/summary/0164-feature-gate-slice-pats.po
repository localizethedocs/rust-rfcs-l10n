"Rust's support for pattern matching on slices has grown steadily and "
"incrementally without a lot of oversight. We have concern that Rust is doing "
"too much here, and that the complexity is not worth it. This RFC proposes to "
"feature gate multiple-element slice matches in the head and middle positions "
"(`[xs.., 0, 0]` and `[0, xs.., 0]`)."

msgid ""
"Some general reasons and one specific: first, the implementation of Rust's "
"match machinery is notoriously complex, and not well-loved. Removing "
"features is seen as a valid way to reduce complexity. Second, slice matching "
"in particular, is difficult to implement, while also being of only moderate "
"utility (there are many types of collections - slices just happen to be "
"built into the language). Finally, the exhaustiveness check is not correct "
"for slice patterns because of their complexity; it's not known if it can be "
"done correctly, nor whether it is worth the effort to do so."

"The `advanced_slice_patterns` feature gate will be added. When the compiler "
"encounters slice pattern matches in head or middle position it will emit a "
"warning or error according to the current settings."
