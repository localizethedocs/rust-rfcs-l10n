#: src/0469-feature-gate-box-patterns.md:11
msgid ""
"A recent RFC (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/462) proposed renaming "
"`box` patterns to `deref`. The discussion that followed indicates that while "
"the language community may be in favour of some sort of renaming, there is "
"no significant consensus around any concrete proposal, including the "
"original one or any that emerged from the discussion."
msgstr ""

#: src/0469-feature-gate-box-patterns.md:13
msgid ""
"This RFC proposes moving `box` patterns behind a feature gate to postpone "
"that discussion and decision to when it becomes more clear how `box` "
"patterns should interact with types other than `Box`."
msgstr ""

#: src/0469-feature-gate-box-patterns.md:15
msgid ""
"In addition, in the future `box` patterns are expected to be made more "
"general by enabling them to destructure any type that implements one of the "
"`Deref` family of traits. As such a generalisation may potentially lead to "
"some currently valid programs being rejected due to the interaction with "
"type inference or other language features, it is desirable that this "
"particular feature stays feature gated until then."
