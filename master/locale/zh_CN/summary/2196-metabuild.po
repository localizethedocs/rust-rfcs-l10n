msgid ""
"Introduce a mechanism for Cargo crates to make use of declarative build "
"scripts, obtained from one or more of their dependencies rather than via a "
"`build.rs` file. Support experimentation with declarative build scripts in "
"the crates.io ecosystem."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2196-metabuild.md:15
msgid ""
"Cargo has many potentially desirable enhancements planned for its build "
"process, including integrating a Cargo build process with native "
"dependencies, and integrating with broader build systems or projects, such "
"as massive mono-repo build systems, or Linux distributions."
msgstr ""

#: src/2196-metabuild.md:20
msgid ""
"Right now, the biggest problem facing such systems involves `build.rs` "
"scripts and the arbitrary things those scripts can do. Such build systems "
"typically need more information about native dependencies that are embedded "
"in `build.rs`, so that they can provide their own versions of those "
"dependencies, or encode appropriate dependencies in another metadata format "
"such as the dependencies of their packaging system or build system. Right "
"now, such systems often have to override the `build.rs` script themselves, "
"and do custom per-crate integration work, manually; there’s no way to "
"introspect what `build.rs` does, or get a declarative semantic description "
"of the build script."
msgstr ""

#: src/2196-metabuild.md:30
msgid ""
"At the same time, we don't yet have sufficiently precise information about "
"the needs of such systems to design an ideal set of Cargo metadata on the "
"first try. Rather than attempt to architect the perfect solution from the "
"start, and potentially create an intermediate state that will require long-"
"term support, we propose to allow experimentation with declarative build "
"systems within the crates.io ecosystem, in crates supplying modular "
"components similar to `build.rs` scripts. By convention, such scripts should "
"typically read any parameters and metadata they need from `Cargo.toml`, in a "
"form that other build-related software can read as well."

"In the `[package]` section of `Cargo.toml`, you can specify a field "
"`metabuild`, whose value should be a string or list of strings, each one "
"exactly matching the name of a dependency specified in the `[build-"
"dependencies]` section. If you specify `metabuild`, you must not specify "
"`build`, and Cargo will ignore the `build.rs` file if any."

"When Cargo builds a crate that specifies a `metabuild` field, at the point "
"when it would have built and run `build.rs`, it will instead invoke the "
"`metabuild()` function from each of the specified crates in order."
msgstr ""

"In effect, Cargo will act as though it had a `build.rs` file containing an "
"`extern crate` line for each string, in order, as well as a `main` function "
"that calls the `metabuild` function in each such crate, in order. For "
"example, if the crate contains `metabuild = [\"pkgc\", \"parsegen\"]`, then "
"the effective `build.rs` will look like this:"

"Future versions of this interface with higher integration into Cargo may "
"incorporate ways for Cargo to pass pre-parsed data from `Cargo.toml`, or "
"ways for the `metabuild` functions to return semantic error information. "
"Metabuild interfaces may also wish to run scripts in parallel, provide "
"dependencies between them, or orchestrate their execution in many other "
"ways. This minimal specification allows for experimentation with such "
"interfaces within the crates.io ecosystem, by providing an adapter from the "
"raw metabuild interface."

"Cargo's logic to invoke `build.rs` should check for the `metabuild` key, and "
"if present, create and invoke a temporary `build.rs` as described above. For "
"an initial implementation, Cargo can generate and cache that `build.rs` in "
"the `target` directory when needed, alongside the built version of the "
"script."

"For Cargo schema versioning, using the `metabuild` key will result in the "
"crate requiring a sufficiently new version of Cargo to understand "
"`metabuild`. This should start out as an unstable Cargo feature; in the "
"course of experimentation and stabilization, the implementation of this "
"feature may change, requiring adaptation of experimental build scripts."

"If any of the strings mentioned in `metabuild` do not match one of the build-"

"`metabuild` could always point to a single crate, and not support a list of "

"\"list of crate names\" functionality, along with more advanced flows of "
"information from one such crate to another. However, many simple cases will "

"`metabuild()` functions could take parameters, return errors, or make use of "

"We could avoid introducing an extensible mechanism, and instead introduce "
