msgid ""
"This RFC defines an official Rust style guide. The style is a specification "
"for the default behaviour of [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/"
"rustfmt), is required for official Rust projects (including the compiler and "
"standard libraries), and is recommended for all Rust projects. The style "
"guide in this RFC only covers the formatting of code, it does not have any "
"recommendations about how to write idiomatic or high quality Rust code."
msgstr ""

#: src/2436-style-guide.md:11
msgid ""
"The formatting guidelines in the style guide have been decided on in the "
"[formatting RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/"
"text/1607-style-rfcs.md) by the style team. The guidelines were [extensively "
"debated](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues?"
"utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) and this RFC is the result of that consensus "
"process. I would like to discourage re-opening debate on the guidelines "
"themselves here. Please limit discussion to the presentation and application "
"of the guide, omissions from the guide, and issues which were missed in the "
"formatting RFC process."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2436-style-guide.md:18
msgid ""
"Formatting code is a mostly mechanical task which takes both time and mental "
"effort. By using an automatic formatting tool, a programmer is relieved of "
"this task and can concentrate on more important things."
msgstr ""

#: src/2436-style-guide.md:20
msgid ""
"Furthermore, by sticking to an established style guide (such as this one), "
"programmers don't need to formulate ad hoc style rules, nor do they need to "
"debate with other programmers what style rules should be used, saving time, "
"communication overhead, and mental energy."
msgstr ""

#: src/2436-style-guide.md:22
msgid ""
"Humans comprehend information through pattern matching. By ensuring that all "
"Rust code has similar formatting, less mental effort is required to "
"comprehend a new project, lowering the bar to entry for new developers."
msgstr ""

#: src/2436-style-guide.md:24
msgid ""
"Thus, there are productivity benefits to using a formatting tool (such as "
"rustfmt), and even larger benefits by using a community-consistent "
"formatting, typically by using a formatting tool's default settings."
msgstr ""

#: src/2436-style-guide.md:26
msgid "Options"
msgstr ""

#: src/2436-style-guide.md:28
msgid ""
"Rustfmt has many options for customising formatting. The behaviour of those "
"options is outside the scope of this RFC. We recommend that users do not "
"configure Rustfmt using the available options and use the default settings. "
"The reason for doing so is consistency in code formatting across the "
"ecosystem - this lowers the bar for developers to move from one project to "
"another because they don't need to get used to reading a new style of "
"formatting."

"Many alternative formatting guidelines were discussed in the [formatting RFC "

"utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue). The guiding principles behind that process are "

"A possible alternative to this style of style guide would be to try and "
"provide a complete and exhaustive specification, such that if any two tools "
"correctly implemented the specification, they would always format code in "
"the same style. However, this would be a massive undertaking and of limited "
"value (it would permit projects to move easily from one tool to another, but "
"since the tools would be so constrained, there would be little benefit in "
"making a second tool)."

"We could also not have a written style guide and state that the output of "
"Rustfmt is the official Rust style, however, that would not have permitted "
"the community input that the formatting RFC process facilitated, and would "
"not give a good way to judge breaking changes in Rustfmt."
