"Make the `IpAddr`, `Ipv4Addr`, `Ipv6Addr`, `SocketAddr`, `SocketAddrV4`, "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2832-core-net-types.md:16
msgid ""
"The motivation here is to provide common types for both `no_std` and `std` "
"targets which in turn will ease the creation of libraries based around IP "
"addresses. Embedded IoT development is one area where this will be "
"beneficial. IP addresses are portable across all platforms and have no "
"external dependencies which is in line with the definition of the core "
"library."
