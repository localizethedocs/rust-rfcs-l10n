"The proposed change to Cargo is to add the ability to specify user-defined "
"profiles in addition to the five predefined profiles, `dev`, `release`, "
"`test`, `bench`. It is also desired in this scope to reduce confusion "
"regarding where final outputs reside, and increase the flexibility to "
"specify the user-defined profile attributes."

#: src/2678-named-custom-cargo-profiles.md:18
msgid ""
"Past proposal to increase flexibility of Cargo’s build flags for crates "
"within a single cargo build invocation, has resulted in [RFC 2282](https://"
"github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2282-profile-dependencies.md), "
"which adds the flexibility of changing attributes of specific crates under "
"one of the default profiles. However, it does not allow for a full custom "
"profile name definition that can have its own additional final outputs."
msgstr ""

#: src/2678-named-custom-cargo-profiles.md:24

"The motivation is illustrated by a prominent example — the ability to easily "

msgid ""
"For example, suppose we are frequently comparing between both a release "
"build and a super-optimized release+LTO build, we would like Cargo to having "
"two separate `target/` directories, e.g. `target/release`, and `target/"
"release-lto`, for which the binaries and incremental compilation is managed "
"separately. This is so that we can easily switch between the two modes "
"without penalty."
