"Temporaries live for the enclosing block when found in a let-binding. This "
"only holds when the reference to the temporary is taken directly. This logic "
"should be extended to extend the cleanup scope of any temporary whose "
"lifetime ends up in the let-binding."

"Temporary lifetimes are a bit confusing right now. Sometimes you can keep "
"references to them, and sometimes you get the dreaded \"borrowed value does "
"not live long enough\" error. Sometimes one operation works but an "
"equivalent operation errors, e.g. autoref of `~[T]` to `&[T]` works but "
"calling `.as_slice()` doesn't. In general it feels as though the compiler is "
"simply being overly restrictive when it decides the temporary doesn't live "
"long enough."

"When a reference to a temporary is passed to a function (either as a regular "
"argument or as the `self` argument of a method), and the function returns a "
"value with the same lifetime as the temporary reference, the lifetime of the "
"temporary should be extended the same way it would if the function was not "
"invoked."

"For example, `~[T].as_slice()` takes `&'a self` and returns `&'a [T]`. "
"Calling `as_slice()` on a temporary of type `~[T]` will implicitly take a "
"reference `&'a ~[T]` and return a value `&'a [T]` This return value should "
"be considered to extend the lifetime of the `~[T]` temporary just as taking "
"an explicit reference (and skipping the method call) would."
