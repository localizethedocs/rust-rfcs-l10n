msgstr ""

#: src/2835-project-safe-transmute.md:21
msgid ""
"Transmuting one type to another type and vice versa in Rust is extremely "
"dangerous --- so much so that the docs for [std::mem::transmute](https://doc."
"rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html) are essentially a long list of how "
"to avoid doing so. However, transmuting is often times necessary especially "
"in lower level contexts where copy of bytes is prohibitively expensive. For "
"instance, in extremely performance-sensitive use cases, it may be necessary "
"to transmute from bytes instead of explicitly copying bytes from a buffer "
"into a struct."
msgstr ""

#: src/2835-project-safe-transmute.md:28
msgid ""
"Because of this fact, [many](https://docs.rs/zerocopy) [external](https://"
"docs.rs/safe-transmute) [crates](https://docs.rs/bytemuck) have been "
"developed to tackle this issue, but no single crate has managed to solidify "
"itself as a clear favorite in this space. Additionally, while it is possible "
"to improve on unsafe transmute considerably in libraries, having such "
"facilities in the standard library opens up the possibility of bringing safe "
"constructs to even more currently unsafe features."

"For these reasons, we plan on learning from the prior art to implement a "
