"The `||` unboxed closure form should be split into two forms—`||` for "
"nonescaping closures and `move ||` for escaping closures—and the capture "
"clauses and self type specifiers should be removed."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0231-upvar-capture-inference.md:11
msgid ""
"Having to specify `ref` and the capture mode for each unboxed closure is "
"inconvenient (see Rust PR rust-lang/rust#16610). It would be more convenient "
"for the programmer if the type of the closure and the modes of the upvars "
"could be inferred. This also eliminates the \"line-noise\" syntaxes like `|"
"&:|`, which are arguably unsightly."
msgstr ""

#: src/0231-upvar-capture-inference.md:13
msgid ""
"Not all knobs can be removed, however—the programmer must manually specify "
"whether each closure is escaping or nonescaping. To see this, observe that "
"no sensible default for the closure `|| (*x).clone()` exists: if the "
"function is nonescaping, it's a closure that returns a copy of `x` every "
"time but does not move `x` into it; if the function is escaping, it's a "
"closure that returns a copy of `x` and takes ownership of `x`."

"Therefore, we need two forms: one for _nonescaping_ closures and one for "
"_escaping_ closures. Nonescaping closures are the commonest, so they get the "
"`||` syntax that we have today, and a new `move ||` syntax will be "
"introduced for escaping closures."

"We introduce a new grammar production, `move ||`. The value returned by a "
"`move ||` implements `FnOnce`, `FnMut`, or `Fn`, as determined above; thus, "
"for example, `move |x: int, y| x + y` produces an unboxed closure that "
"implements the `Fn(int, int) -> int` trait (and thus the `FnOnce(int, int) -"
"> int` trait by inheritance). Free variables referenced by a `move ||` "
"closure are always captured by value."

"In the trait reference grammar, we will change the `|&:|` sugar to `Fn()`, "
"the `|&mut:|` sugar to `FnMut()`, and the `|:|` sugar to `FnOnce()`. Thus "
"what was before written `fn foo<F:|&mut: int, int| -> int>()` will be `fn "
"foo<F:FnMut(int, int) -> int>()`."

"It is important to note that the trait reference syntax and closure "
"construction syntax are purposefully distinct. This is because either the `||"
"` form or the `move ||` form can construct any of `FnOnce`, `FnMut`, or `Fn` "
"closures."
