"Official web content produced by the Rust teams for consumption by Rust "
"users should work in the majority of browsers that Rust users are visiting "
"these sites in. The Rust compiler only supports [a finite number of targets]"
"(https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html), with varying degrees of "
"support, due to the limits on time, expertise, and testing resources. "
"Similarly, we don't have enough time, expertise and testing resources to be "

"Supporting all versions of all browsers with the same behavior is impossible "

"not currently doing any cross-browser testing; there are some JavaScript "
"tests of the UI that run in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), a headless "

"In order to fully test on all browsers to be sure of our support, we would "

"testing on all of these, or we would need to be running automated tests on "
"something like [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/pricing). "
"BrowserStack does appear to have a free plan for open source projects, but "
"it's unclear how many parallel tests the open source plan would give us, and "
"we'd at least be spending time waiting for test results on the various "
"stacks. [BrowserStack also doesn't support every platform](https://www."
