"This RFC proposes the `mod` keyword used to refer the immediate parent "
"namespace in `use` items (`use a::b::{mod, c}`) to be changed to `self`."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:13
msgid "While this looks fine:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:25
msgid "This looks strange, since we are not really importing a module:"

"RFC #168 was written when there was no namespaced `enum`, therefore the "
"choice of the keyword was suboptimal."

msgid "Detailed design"
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:38
msgid ""
"This RFC simply proposes to use `self` in place of `mod`. This should amount "
"to one line change to the parser, possibly with a renaming of relevant AST "
"node (`PathListMod`)."

msgid "Drawbacks"
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:44
msgid ""
"`self` is already used to denote a relative path in the `use` item. While "
"they can be clearly distinguished (any use of `self` proposed in this RFC "
"will appear inside braces), this can cause some confusion to beginners."

"Don't do this. Simply accept that `mod` also acts as a general term for "
"namespaces."
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:54
msgid ""
"Allow `enum` to be used in place of `mod` when the parent item is `enum`. "
"This clearly expresses the intent and it doesn't reuse `self`. However, this "
"is not very future-proof for several reasons."
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:58
msgid ""
"Any item acting as a namespace would need a corresponding keyword. This is "
"backward compatible but cumbersome."
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:60
msgid ""
"If such namespace is not defined with an item but only implicitly, we may "
"not have a suitable keyword to use."
msgstr ""

#: src/0532-self-in-use.md:62
msgid ""
"We currently import all items sharing the same name (e.g. `struct P(Q);`), "
"with no way of selectively importing one of them by the item type. An "
"explicit item type in `use` will imply that we _can_ selectively import, "
"while we actually can't."
