"Throughout its life, `static_assert` has been... weird. Graydon suggested it "
"[in May of 2013](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/6568), and it was "
"[implemented](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/6670) shortly after. "
"[Another issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/6676) was created "
"to give it a ‘better interface’. Here’s why:"

"In other words, `assertion` above ends up as a symbol in the final output. "

"So why not improve `static_assert`? With compile time function evaluation, "
"the idea of a ‘static assertion’ doesn’t need to have language semantics. "
"Either `const` functions or full-blown CTFE is a useful feature in its own "
"right that we’ve said we want in Rust. In light of it being eventually "
"added, `static_assert` doesn’t make sense any more."
