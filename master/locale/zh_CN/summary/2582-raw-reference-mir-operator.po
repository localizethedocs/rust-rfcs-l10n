"Introduce new variants of the `&` operator: `&raw mut <place>` to create a "
"`*mut <T>`, and `&raw const <place>` to create a `*const <T>`. This creates "
"a raw pointer directly, as opposed to the already existing `&mut <place> as "
"*mut _`/`&<place> as *const _`, which create a temporary reference and then "
"cast that to a raw pointer. As a consequence, the existing expressions "
"`<term> as *mut <T>` and `<term> as *const <T>` where `<term>` has reference "
"type are equivalent to `&raw mut *<term>` and `&raw const *<term>`, "

"Currently, if one wants to create a raw pointer pointing to something, one "
"has no choice but to create a reference and immediately cast it to a raw "
"pointer. The problem with this is that there are some invariants that we "
"want to attach to references, that have to _always hold_. The details of "
"this are not finally decided yet, but true in practice because of "
"annotations we emit to LLVM. It is also the next topic of discussion in the "
"[Unsafe Code Guidelines](https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-"
"guidelines/). In particular, references must be aligned and dereferenceable, "
"even when they are created and never used."

"One consequence of these rules is that it becomes essentially impossible to "
"create a raw pointer pointing to an unaligned struct field: `&packed.field "
"as *const _` creates an intermediate unaligned reference, triggering "
"undefined behavior because it is not aligned. Instead, code currently has to "
"copy values around to aligned locations if pointers need to be passed, e.g., "
"to FFI, as in:"

"Another issue people sometimes run into is computing the address/offset of a "

"Rust contains two operators that perform place-to-value conversion (matching "
"`&` in C): one to create a reference (with some given mutability) and one to "
"create a raw pointer (with some given mutability). In the MIR, this is "
"reflected as either a distinct `Rvalue` or a flag on the existing `Ref` "
"variant. Lowering to MIR should _not_ insert an implicit reborrow of "
"`<place>` in `&raw mut <place>`; that reborrow would assert validity and "
"thus defeat the entire point. The borrow checker should do the usual checks "
"on the place used in `&raw`, but can just ignore the result of this "
"operation and the newly created \"reference\" can have any lifetime. When "
"translating MIR to LLVM, nothing special has to happen as references and raw "
"pointers have the same LLVM type anyway; the new operation behaves like "
"`Ref`. When interpreting MIR in the Miri engine, the engine will know not to "
"enforce any invariants on the raw pointer created by `&raw`."

"Moreover, to prevent programmers from accidentally creating a safe reference "
"when they did not want to, we add a lint that identifies situations where "
"the programmer likely wants a raw reference, and suggest an explicit cast in "
"that case. One possible heuristic here would be: If a safe reference (shared "
"or mutable) is only ever used to create raw pointers, then likely it could "
"be a raw pointer to begin with. The details of this are best worked out in "
"the implementation phase of this RFC. The lint should, at the very least, "
"fire for the cases covered by the [syntactic sugar extension](#future-"
"possibilities), and it should fire when the factor that prevents this "
"matching the sugar is just a redundant block, such as `{ &mut <place> } as "
