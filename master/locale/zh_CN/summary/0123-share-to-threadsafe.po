msgid ""
"With interior mutability, the name \"immutable pointer\" for a value of type "
"`&T` is not quite accurate. Instead, the term \"shared reference\" is "
"becoming popular to reference values of type `&T`. The usage of the term "
"\"shared\" is in conflict with the `Share` trait, which is intended for "
"types which can be safely shared concurrently with a shared reference."

"Rename the `Share` trait in `std::kinds` to `Sync`. Documentation would "
"refer to `&T` as a shared reference and the notion of \"shared\" would "
"simply mean \"many references\" while `Sync` implies that it is safe to "
"share among many threads."

"The name `Sync` may invoke conceptions of \"synchronized\" from languages "
"such as Java where locks are used, rather than meaning \"safe to access in a "
"shared fashion across tasks\"."
