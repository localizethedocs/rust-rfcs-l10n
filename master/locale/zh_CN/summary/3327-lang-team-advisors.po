msgid ""
"There are many folks who regularly aid the Rust community and the lang team "
"in particular in language design decisions, but who for various reasons it "
"doesn't make sense to add to the team as full members. In practice, if one "
"of those people raises an objection on a feature, that is given quite a lot "
"of weight, but our process doesn't have any official way to recognize them. "
"The lang team advisors subteam closes this gap, allowing us to recognize "
"advisors publicly and to give them the ability to lodge formal objections "
"that block FCP."

"The **lang-team advisors** is a subteam of the lang team that contains "

"also be a useful stepping stone towards full membership, giving someone a "
