msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/3872-crates-io-security.md:17
msgid ""
"One of the roles that crates.io serves for Rust developers is as a discovery "
"mechanism for library packages. As such, it is important that users can "
"quickly assess the quality of a given crate, including security "
"considerations such as unsound code/API or known vulnerabilities. The "
"RustSec advisory database is a curated database of security advisories for "
"Rust crates, which tracks known vulnerabilities, unsound code, and "
"maintenance status of crates."
msgstr ""

#: src/3872-crates-io-security.md:23
msgid ""
"The Rust ecosystem has a culture of having smaller, focused crates with a "
"clear purpose. As a result, many Rust projects have a large number of "
"dependencies, which increases the risk of introducing problems in the final "
"artifact via the supply chain of dependencies. Actively malicious crates (or "
"crate versions) would be one example of these risks; the crates.io team "
"handles these by deleting them when discovered."
msgstr ""

#: src/3872-crates-io-security.md:29

"This RFC concerns itself mostly with unintentional vulnerabilities and "
"unsound APIs. An example from the Java ecosystem is the [Log4Shell](https://"
"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j#Log4Shell_vulnerability) vulnerability in the "
"popular Log4j logging library, when a widely used package exposed affected "
"services to remote code execution attacks."

"The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) has enumerated [Principles for "

"The RustSec advisory database tooling already supports exporting advisories "
"in the OSV format. Today, crates.io does not display any information about "
"known vulnerabilities or unsound APIs for a given crate. Devising how best "
"to surface this information across a project dependency graph is a more "
"complex problem that is outside the scope of this RFC (but see future work)."

"The crates.io website will display information about known vulnerabilities "

"We want to convey a quick overview of the security status of a crate, and "
"allow users to make informed decisions about whether to use the crate in "
"their projects. Care should be taken to ensure that the mere existence of "
"past vulnerabilities does not negatively impact the perceived quality of a "
"crate; very popular crates are much more likely to have vulnerabilities "
"reported against them, simply due to their popularity and the amount of "
"scrutiny."

"Add a `Security` tab to crate pages. If there are known vulnerabilities for "
"the currently selected version, the tab might be highlighted. The Security "
"tab will be there whether there are existing advisories for a crate or not. "
"Opening the Security tab for a crate should show a list of advisories that "
"affect the crate, including a summary of the issue, a list of affected "
"versions, and links to more information."

"The RustSec project publishes a number of Rust crates that can be used to "

"The RustSec project is maintained by an independent team of volunteers, so "

"[ongoing discussion](https://github.com/rust-lang/leadership-council/"
"issues/140) on governance for the Secure Code WG that governs the RustSec "
"project, which might be relevant to this proposal. Feedback on the RustSec "
"advisory data can be fed back to the RustSec team via their issue tracker."

"Rust developers might be scared off of using crates that have known "
"vulnerabilities, even if those vulnerabilities are not relevant to their use "
"case, or have been fixed in later versions. This seems like a reasonable "
"trade-off to me -- we should allow informed users to make decisions that are "
"best for their projects."

"Widely used tools like [cargo-audit](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit) "
"and [cargo-deny](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deny) already provide a way "
"to check for security-sensitive issues in a Rust project's dependencies, but "
"these tools are opt-in and require users to be aware of them and to run "
"them. They are also more focused on auditing a project's existing "
"dependencies rather than helping inform users in the discovery phase."

"In the future, it would be valuable if lockfile updates exposed open "

"`SECURITY.md` files are often used to communicate a project's security "

"Security page. However, `SECURITY.md` files commonly live in the repository "
"root, which is often a crate workspace, and thus is not directly associated "
"with a specific crate. Some prerequisite work in Cargo would probably be "
"needed to associate a crate with the relevant `SECURITY.md` file."
