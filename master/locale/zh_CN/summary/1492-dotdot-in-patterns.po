"The pattern fragment `..` can be used in some patterns to denote several "
"elements in list contexts. However, it doesn't always compiles when used in "
"such contexts. One can expect the ability to match tuple variants like "
"`V(u8, u8, u8)` with patterns like `V(x, ..)` or `V(.., z)`, but the "
"compiler rejects such patterns currently despite accepting very similar "
"`V(..)`."
