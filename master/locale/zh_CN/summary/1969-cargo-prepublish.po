msgid ""
"This RFC proposes the concept of _patching sources_ for Cargo. Sources can "
"be have their existing versions of crates replaced with different copies, "
"and sources can also have \"prepublished\" crates by adding versions of a "
"crate which do not currently exist in the source. Dependency resolution will "
"work _as if_ these additional or replacement crates actually existed in the "
"original source."
msgstr ""

#: src/1969-cargo-prepublish.md:15
msgid ""
"One primary feature enabled by this is the ability to \"prepublish\" a crate "
"to crates.io. Prepublication makes it possible to perform integration "
"testing within a large crate graph before publishing anything to crates.io, "
"and without requiring dependencies to be switched from the crates.io index "
"to git branches. It can, to a degree, simulate an \"atomic\" change across a "
"large number of crates and repositories, which can then actually be landed "
"in a piecemeal, non-atomic fashion."

msgstr ""

#: src/1969-cargo-prepublish.md:26
msgid ""
"Large Rust projects often end up pulling in dozens or hundreds of crates "
"from crates.io, and those crates often depend on each other as well. If the "
"project author wants to contribute a change to one of the crates nestled "
"deep in the graph (say, `xml-rs`), they face a couple of related challenges:"
msgstr ""

#: src/1969-cargo-prepublish.md:31
msgid ""
"Before submitting a PR upstream to `xml-rs`, they will usually want to try "
"integrating the change within their project, to make sure it actually meets "
"their needs and doesn't lead to unexpected problems. That might involve a "
"_cascade_ of changes if several crates in the graph depend on `xml-rs`. How "
"do they go about this kind of integration work prior to sending a PR?"
msgstr ""

#: src/1969-cargo-prepublish.md:37
msgid ""
"If the change to the upstream `xml-rs` crate is breaking (would require a "
"new major version), it's vital to carefully track which other crates in the "
"graph have successfully been updated to this version, and which ones are "
"still at the old version (and can stay there). This issue is related to the "
"notion of [private dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/"
"issues/2064), which should have a separate RFC in the near future."
msgstr ""

"Once they're satisfied with the change to `xml-rs` (and any other "
"intermediate crates), they'll need to make PRs and request a new publication "
"to crates.io. But they would like to cleanly continue local development in "
"the meantime, with an easy migration as each PR lands and each crate is "
"published."

"You might reach for git (or even path) dependencies. That would mean, for "
"example, switching an `xml-rs` dependency in your crate graph from crates.io "
"to point at, for example, a forked copy on github. The problem is that "
"**this approach does not provide enough dependency unification**: if other "
"parts of the crate graph refer to the crates.io version of `xml-rs`, it is "
"treated as an entirely separate library and thus compiled separately. That "

"The listed dependencies have the same syntax as the normal `[dependencies]` "

"what's going on with version resolution. A good example of this is the "
"\"breaking change\" example above where we ended up with three versions of "
"`xml-rs` after our prepublished version. It's crucial that 0.9.1 was still "
"in the lock file because we hadn't updated that dependency on 0.9.1 yet, so "
"it wasn't ready for 0.10.0. With `[replace]`, however, we would only "
"possibly be able to replace all usage of 0.9.1 with 0.10.0, not having an "
"incremental solution."

"It would be extremely helpful to provide a first-class workflow for forking "

"prepublication, and for fixing things up when publication actually occurs. "
"That shouldn't be hard to do, but is out of scope for this RFC."
