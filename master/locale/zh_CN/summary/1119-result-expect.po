#: src/1119-result-expect.md:12
msgid ""
"While `Result::unwrap` exists, it does not allow annotating the panic "
"message with the operation attempted (e.g. what file was being opened). This "
"is at odds to 'Option' which includes both `unwrap` and `expect` (with the "
"latter taking an arbitrary failure message)."

msgid ""
"Add a new method to the same `impl` block as `Result::unwrap` that takes a "
"`&str` message and returns `T` if the `Result` was `Ok`. If the `Result` was "
"`Err`, it panics with both the provided message and the error value."
