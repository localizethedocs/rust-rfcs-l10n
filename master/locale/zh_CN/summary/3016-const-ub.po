msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:13
msgid ""
"So far, nothing is specified about what happens when `unsafe` code leads to "
"UB during CTFE. This is a major blocker for stabilizing `unsafe` operations "
"in const-contexts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Guide-level explanation"
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:19
msgid ""
"There are some values that Rust needs to compute at compile-time. This "
"includes the initial value of a `const`/`static`, and array lengths (and "
"more general, const generics). Computing these initial values is called "
"compile-time function evaluation (CTFE). CTFE in Rust is very powerful and "
"permits running almost arbitrary Rust code. This raises the question, what "
"happens when there is `unsafe` code and it causes [Undefined Behavior (UB)]"
"(https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html)?"
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:25
msgid ""
"The answer is that in this case, the final value that is currently being "
"executed is arbitrary. For example, when UB arises while computing an array "
"length, then the final array length can be any `usize`, or it can be "
"(partially) uninitialized. No guarantees are made about this final value, "
"and it can be different depending on host and target architecture, compiler "
"flags, and more. However, UB will not otherwise adversely affect the "
"currently running compiler; type-checking and lints and everything else will "
"work correctly given whatever the result of the CTFE computation is. In "
"particular, when the same constant is used in two different crates, those "
"crates will still definitely see the same value for that constant -- "
"anything else would break the type system."
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:31
msgid ""
"Note, however, that this means compile-time UB can later cause runtime UB "
"when the program is actually executed: for example, if there is UB while "
"computing the initial value of a `Vec<i32>`, the result might be a "
"completely invalid vector that causes UB at runtime when used in the program."
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:34
msgid ""
"Sometimes, the compiler might be able to detect such problems and show an "
"error or warning about CTFE computation having gone wrong (for example, the "
"compiler might detect when the array length ends up being uninitialized). "
"But other times, this might not be the case -- there is no guarantee that UB "
"is reliably detected during CTFE. This can change from compiler version to "
"compiler version: CTFE code that causes UB could build fine with one "
"compiler and fail to build with another. (This is in accordance with the "
"general policy that unsound code is not subject to stability guarantees.) "
"Implementations are encouraged to perform as many UB checks as they feasibly "
"can, and they are encouraged to document which UB is and is not detected "
"during CTFE and what the consequences of undetected UB can be, but none of "
"this is required."

msgid ""
"This means UB during CTFE can silently \"corrupt\" the build in a way that "

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:76
msgid "Rationale and alternatives"
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:79
msgid ""
"The most obvious alternative is to say that UB during CTFE will definitely "
"be detected. However, that is expensive and might even be impossible. Even "
"Miri does not currently detect all UB, and Miri is already performing many "
"additional checks that would significantly slow down CTFE. Furthermore, "
"since optimizations can \"hide\" UB (an optimization can turn a program with "
"UB into one without), this means we have to keep running CTFE on unoptimized "
"MIR. And finally, implementing these checks requires a more precise "
"understanding of UB than we currently have; basically, this would block "
"having any potentially-UB operations at const-time on having a spec for Rust "
"that precisely describes their UB in a checkable way. In particular, this "
"would mean we need to decide on an aliasing model before permitting raw "
"pointers in CTFE."
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:86
msgid ""
"Another extreme alternative would be to say that UB during CTFE may have "
"arbitrary effects in the host compiler, including host-level UB. Basically "
"this would mean that CTFE would be allowed to \"leave its sandbox\". This "
"would allow JIT'ing CTFE and running the resulting code unchecked. While "
"compiling untrusted code should only be done with care (including additional "
"sandboxing), this seems like an unnecessary extra footgun."
msgstr ""

#: src/3016-const-ub.md:91
msgid ""
"A possible middle-ground is to guarantee to detect _some UB_. However, what "
"is cheap and/or easy to detect might change over time as the implementation "
"of CTFE evolves, so to avoid drawing Rust into a corner, this RFC avoids "
"making any such guarantees."

msgid ""
"C++ requires compilers to detect UB in `constexpr`. However, the fragment of "
"C++ that is available to `constexpr` excludes pointer casts, pointer "
"arithmetic (beyond array bounds), and union-based type punning, which makes "
"such checks not very complicated and avoids most of the poorly specified "
"parts of UB."

"This RFC provides an easy way forward for \"unconst\" operations, i.e., "
"operations that are safe at run-time but not at compile-time. Primary "
"examples of such operations are anything involving the integer "
"representation of pointers, which cannot be known at compile-time. If this "
"RFC were accepted, we could declare such operations UB during CTFE (and thus "
"naturally they would only be permitted in an `unsafe` block). This still "
"leaves the door open for providing better guarantees in the future."
