"In the course of developing this RFC, and thinking extensively about the "
"structure and operation of the Council, the interim leadership team also "
"identified many other tasks that fell outside the scope of this RFC, and "
"explicitly decided to defer those tasks to the new Council. This section "
"documents those tasks, as a suggested starting point for bootstrapping the "
"work of the Council. None of these are binding suggestions, and the Council "
"can freely set and prioritize its own agenda; this section serves as a "
"public, transparent handoff of knowledge and proposals to the Leadership "
"Council."

"Some of these tasks represent meta-level decisions about the processes of "
"the Council, and we chose not to make those decisions in this RFC to avoid "
"enshrining a particular structure rather than deferring to those who will be "
"working regularly with that structure. The remaining tasks represent a "
"partial todo list of long-standing tasks that fall within the Council's "
"purview, insofar as they have fallen through the gaps between team purviews. "
"Some of these tasks should be delegated by the Council rather than worked on "
"directly by the Council. The inclusion of a task in this list doesn't change "
"what type of decision-making process is required for it; some of these may "
"be Council-internal operational decisions or private operational decisions, "
"while others will require a public policy process."
