msgid ""
"The following are non-goals of this RFC. These may be met in future RFCs but "
"are explicitly not part of this RFC."
msgstr ""

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:5
msgid ""
"Non-goal #1: _Laying out the complete policies and procedures of the "
"Council_. While the RFC lays out and bounds the structure of the Council, "
"the Council's full policies and procedures will be created by the Council "
"itself. It is also expected that the Council will change and adapt to meet "
"the needs of the Rust Project as it evolves."
msgstr ""

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:7
msgid ""
"Non-goal #2: _Addressing all governance and potential governance concerns_. "
"One of the Council's responsibilities will be to identify and reflect on the "
"issues present in governance, but we see the formation of the Council as "
"part of a continuous process of improving Rust's leadership and how it meets "
"the needs of the Project."
msgstr ""

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:9
msgid ""
"Non-goal #3: _Forming additional teams_. The focus of this RFC is to form "
"the Council and does not include the creation of additional teams, subteams, "
"or groups of any kind."
msgstr ""

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:11
msgid ""
"We recognize the importance of having additional teams, but see this as "
"outside of the scope of this RFC. Instead, it will be the responsibility of "
"the Council to investigate and understand such needs and then create "
"additional teams to ultimately handle these issues."
msgstr ""

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:13
msgid ""
"This has one exception, other than the Council itself: the \"launching pad\" "
"top-level team, which provides a temporary grouping of teams not yet "
"attached to any existing top-level team either directly or indirectly."
msgstr ""

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:15
msgid ""
"Non-goal #4: _Altering the charters or purviews of existing teams_. While "
"this RFC does discuss membership in the Council, it does not extend beyond "
"this to update the charter or purview of any existing team. Existing teams "
"continue to follow their existing charters and purviews."

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:17
msgid "This has two exceptions:"

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:19
msgid ""
"the core team: As part of this RFC, all of the capabilities and "
"responsibilities of the core team move to the Council and are then "
"clarified, modified, and constrained by the rest of this RFC."
msgstr ""

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:20
msgid ""
"the moderation team: As this RFC covers topics like conflict resolution and "
"Council oversight, it does define additional capabilities for the moderation "
"team, as well as additional checks and balances providing bidirectional "
"oversight between the moderation team and the Council."

#: src/3392-leadership-council/non-goals.md:22
msgid ""
"Non-goal #5: _Establishing completely immutable properties of the Council_. "
"Any aspect established in this RFC can be modified in the future, via the "
"public policy decision-making process, with oversight provided by that "
"process. This RFC lays out policies for making such changes, and the "
"processes of changing such policies must follow the existing policies."
