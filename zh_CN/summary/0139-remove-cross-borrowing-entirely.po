"The coercion between `Box<T>` to `&T` is not replicable by user-defined "
"smart pointers and has been found to be rarely used [1](https://github.com/"
"rust-lang/rust/pull/15171). We already removed the coercion between `Box<T>` "
"and `&mut T` in RFC 33."

"Note that methods that take `&self` can still be called on values of type "
"`Box<T>` without any special referencing or dereferencing. That is because "
"the semantics of auto-deref and auto-ref conspire to make it work: the types "
"unify after one autoderef followed by one autoref."
