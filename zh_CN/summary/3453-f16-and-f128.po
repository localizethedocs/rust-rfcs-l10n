msgstr ""

#: src/3453-f16-and-f128.md:14
msgid ""
"The IEEE 754 standard defines many binary floating point formats. The most "
"common of these types are the binary32 and binary64 formats, available in "
"Rust as `f32` and `f64`. However, other formats are useful in various "
"uncommon scenarios. The binary16 format is useful for situations where "
"storage compactness is important and low precision is acceptable, such as "
"HDR images, mesh quantization, and AI neural networks.[^1] The binary128 "
"format is useful for situations where high precision is needed, such as "
"scientific computing contexts."

"This RFC proposes adding `f16` and `f128` primitive types in Rust to "
"represent IEEE 754 binary16 and binary128, respectively. Having `f16` and "
"`f128` types in the Rust language would allow Rust to better support the "
"above mentioned use cases, allowing for optimizations and native support "
"that may not be possible in a third party crate. Additionally, providing a "
"single canonical data type for these floating point representations will "
"make it easier to exchange data between libraries."

"judgement of whether those types should be added in the future, such "
