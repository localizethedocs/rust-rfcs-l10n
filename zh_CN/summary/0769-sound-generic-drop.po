#: src/0769-sound-generic-drop.md:41
msgid ""
"Part of Rust's design is rich use of Resource Acquisition Is Initialization "
"(RAII) patterns, which requires destructors: code attached to certain types "
"that runs only when a value of the type goes out of scope or is otherwise "
"deallocated. In Rust, the `Drop` trait is used for this purpose."
msgstr ""

#: src/0769-sound-generic-drop.md:47
msgid ""
"Currently (as of Rust 1.0 alpha), a developer cannot implement `Drop` on a "
"type- or lifetime-parametric type (e.g. `struct Sneetch<'a>` or `enum "
"Zax<T>`) without attaching the `#[unsafe_destructor]` attribute to it. The "
"reason this attribute is required is that the current implementation allows "
"for such destructors to inject unsoundness accidentally (e.g. reads from or "
"writes to deallocated memory, accessing data when its representation "
"invariants are no longer valid)."
msgstr ""

#: src/0769-sound-generic-drop.md:56
msgid ""
"Furthermore, while some destructors can be implemented with no danger of "
"unsoundness, regardless of `T` (assuming that any `Drop` implementation "
"attached to `T` is itself sound), as soon as one wants to interact with "
"borrowed data within the `fn drop` code (e.g. access a field `&'a "
"StarOffMachine` from a value of type `Sneetch<'a>` ), there is currently no "
"way to enforce a rule that `'a` _strictly_ _outlive_ the value itself. This "
"is a huge gap in the language as it stands: as soon as a developer attaches "
"`#[unsafe_destructor]` to such a type, it is imposing a subtle and "
"_unchecked_ restriction on clients of that type that they will not ever "
"allow the borrowed data to expire first."
