"Asserts are too expensive for release builds and mess up inlining. There "
"must be a way to turn them off. I propose macros `debug_assert!` and `assert!"
"`. For test cases, `assert!` should be used."

"There should be two macros, `debug_assert!(EXPR)` and `assert!(EXPR)`. In "
"debug builds (without `--cfg ndebug`), `debug_assert!()` is the same as "
"`assert!()`. In release builds (with `--cfg ndebug`), `debug_assert!()` "
"compiles away to nothing. The definition of `assert!()` is `if (!EXPR) "
"{ fail!(\"assertion failed ({}, {}): {}\", file!(), line!(), stringify!"
"(expr) }`"

"Other designs that have been considered are using `debug_assert!` in test "

"The impact of not doing this is that `assert!` will be expensive, prompting "
"people will write their own local `debug_assert!` macros, duplicating "
"functionality that should have been in the standard library."
