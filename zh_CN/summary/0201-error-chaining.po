msgstr ""

#: src/0201-error-chaining.md:24
msgid ""
"Typically, a module (or crate) will define a custom error type encompassing "
"the possible error outcomes for the operations it provides, along with a "
"custom `Result` instance baking in this type. For example, we have `io::"
"IoError` and `io::IoResult<T> = Result<T, io::IoError>`, and similarly for "
"other libraries. Together with the `try!` macro, the story for interacting "
"with errors for a single library is reasonably good."
msgstr ""

#: src/0201-error-chaining.md:31
msgid ""
"However, we lack infrastructure when consuming or building on errors from "
"multiple APIs, or abstracting over errors."

"Abstractly, as described by [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"

#: src/0201-error-chaining.md:62
msgid ""
"The `download` function can encounter both `io` and `http` errors, and wants "
"to report them both under the common notion of `CLIError`. But the `try!` "
"macro only works for a single error type at a time."
msgstr ""

#: src/0201-error-chaining.md:66

"There are roughly two scenarios where multiple library error types need to "

"As such, the data needed for application-level errors is usually related to "

"When one library builds on others, it needs to translate from their error "

"In general, a library may not want to reveal the upstream libraries it "

"Finally, libraries sometimes need to work with errors in a generic way. For "

"The standard `Error` trait follows very the widespread pattern found in "
"`Exception` base classes in many languages:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0201-error-chaining.md:163
msgid ""
"Every concrete error type should provide at least a description. By making "

"error types and then implement this method as returning static string slices "
"depending on the variant."
msgstr ""

#: src/0201-error-chaining.md:168
msgid ""
"The `cause` method allows for cause-chaining when an error crosses "
"abstraction boundaries. The cause is recorded as a trait object implementing "
"`Error`, which makes it possible to read off a kind of abstract backtrace "
"(often more immediately helpful than a full backtrace)."

"The `Any` bound is needed to allow _downcasting_ of errors. This RFC "
"stipulates that it must be possible to downcast errors in the style of the "
"`Any` trait, but leaves unspecified the exact implementation strategy.  (If "
"trait object upcasting was available, one could simply upcast to `Any`; "
"otherwise, we will likely need to duplicate the `downcast` APIs as blanket "
"`impl`s on `Error` objects.)"

"Code that returns or asks for an `IoError` explicitly will be able to access "
"the `kind` field and thus react differently to different kinds of errors. "
"But code that works with a generic `Error` (e.g., application code) sees "
"only the human-consumable parts of the error. In particular, application "
"code will often employ `Box<Error>` as the error type when reporting errors "
"to the user. The `try!` macro support, explained below, makes doing so "

msgid ""
"The idea is to introduce a trait `FromError<E>` that says how to convert "

"This code depends on [multidispatch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/"

"Library code that defines its own error type can define custom `FromError` "
"implementations for lifting lower-level errors (where the lifting should "

"The main reason not to include the above two features is so that `Error` can "

"such data structures, it's possible to produce fixed descriptions, but not "
"mutate descriptions or other error properties. Allowing generic creation of "
"any `Error`\\-bounded type would also require these `enum`s to include "
