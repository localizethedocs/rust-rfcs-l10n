"**Project goals** are proposed bottom-up by an **owner**, somebody who is "
"willing to commit resources (time, money, leadership) to seeing the work get "
"done. The owner identifies the problem they want to address and sketches the "
"solution of how they want to do so. They also identify the support they will "
"need from the Rust teams (typically things like review bandwidth or feedback "
"on RFCs). Teams then read the goals and provide feedback. If the goal is "
"approved, teams are committing to support the owner in their work."

"Project goals can vary in scope from an internal refactoring that affects "
"only one team to a larger cross-cutting initiative. No matter its scope, "
"accepting a goal should never be interpreted as a promise that the team will "
"make any future decision (e.g., accepting an RFC that has yet to be "
"written). Rather, it is a promise that the team are aligned on the contents "
"of the goal thus far (including the design axioms and other notes) and will "
"prioritize giving feedback and support as needed."

#: src/3672-Project-Goals-2024h2.md:28

"Of the proposed goals, a small subset are selected by the roadmap owner as "
"**flagship goals**. Flagship goals are chosen for their high impact (many "
"Rust users will be impacted) and their shovel-ready nature (the org is well-"
"aligned around a concrete plan). Flagship goals are the ones that will "
"feature most prominently in our public messaging and which should be "
"prioritized by Rust teams where needed."
