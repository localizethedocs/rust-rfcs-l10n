"Cargo already allows a dependency tree to contain multiple dependencies on "
"the same crate (whether as an artifact dependency or otherwise), by "
"introducing an intermediate crate. This feature provides that capability "
"within the dependencies of a single crate, which should avoid the "
"multiplicative introduction (and potentially publication) of trivial "
"intermediate crates for each target."

#: src/3176-cargo-multi-dep-artifacts.md:151

"This RFC handles building an artifact dependency for multiple targets by "
"requiring a different name for the dependency on each target. As an "
"alternative, we could instead allow specifying a list of targets in the "
"`target` field. This would provide a more brief syntax, but it would require "
"Cargo to incorporate the target name into the environment variables provided "
"for the artifact dependency. Doing so would complicate artifact dependencies "
"significantly, and would also complicate the internals of Cargo. Separating "
"these dependencies under different names makes them easier to manage and "
"reference, both within Cargo and within the code of the crate specifying the "
"dependencies."

#: src/3176-cargo-multi-dep-artifacts.md:162
msgid ""
"While this RFC has artifact dependencies as a primary use case, it also "
"allows specifying multiple non-artifact dependencies on the same crate with "
"different names. This seems like a harmless extension, equivalent to `use "
"name1 as name2;` and similar. However, if it adds any substantive "
"complexity, we could easily restrict this feature exclusively to artifact "
"dependencies, without any harm to the primary use case."

"When building an artifact dependency for a target, the depending crate may "
