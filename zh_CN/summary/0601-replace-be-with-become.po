"A keyword needs to be reserved to support guaranteed tail calls in a "
"backward-compatible way. Currently the keyword reserved for this purpose is "
"`be`, but the `become` alternative was proposed in the old [RFC](https://"
"github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/81) for guaranteed tail calls, which is now "
"postponed and tracked in [PR#271](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/"

"The main alternative is to do nothing, i.e. to keep the `be` keyword "
"reserved for supporting guaranteed tail calls in a backward-compatible way. "
"Using `become` as the keyword for tail calls would not be backward-"
"compatible because it would introduce a new keyword, which might have been "
"used in valid code."

"Another option is to add the `become` keyword, without removing `be`. This "
"would have the same drawbacks as the current proposal (might break existing "
"code), but it would also guarantee that the `become` keyword is available in "
"the future."
