#: src/2128-use-nested-groups.md:28
msgid ""
"The motivation is ergonomics. Prefixes are often shared among imports, "
"especially if many imports import names from the same crate. With this "
"nested grouping it's more often possible to merge common import prefixes and "
"write them once instead of writing them multiple times."

"Some RFCs propose new syntaxes for absolute paths in the current crate and "

"This RFC removes the these statistics from the equation by reducing "
"verbosity for all imports with common prefix.  \n"
