msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:11
msgid ""
"The current terminology of \"task failure\" often causes problems when "
"writing or speaking about code. You often want to talk about the possibility "
"of an operation that returns a `Result` \"failing\", but cannot because of "
"the ambiguity with task failure. Instead, you have to speak of \"the failing "
"case\" or \"when the operation does not succeed\" or other circumlocutions."
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:18
msgid ""
"Likewise, we use a \"Failure\" header in rustdoc to describe when operations "
"may fail the task, but it would often be helpful to separate out a section "
"describing the \"Err-producing\" case."
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:22
msgid ""
"We have been steadily moving away from task failure and toward `Result` as "
"an error-handling mechanism, so we should optimize our terminology "
"accordingly: `Result`\\-producing functions should be easy to describe."

"Not much more to say here than is in the summary: rename \"task failure\" to "

"The choice of `panic` emerged from a [discuss thread](http://discuss.rust-"
"lang.org/t/renaming-task-failure/310/20) and [workweek discussion](https://"
"github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/workweek-2014-08-18/error-"
"handling.md). It has precedent in a language setting in Go, and of course "
"goes back to Kernel panics."
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:40
msgid ""
"With this choice, we can use \"failure\" to refer to an operation that "
"produces `Err` or `None`, \"panic\" for unwinding at the task level, and "
"\"abort\" for aborting the entire process."
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:44
msgid ""
"The connotations of panic seem fairly accurate: the process is not "
"immediately ending, but it is rapidly fleeing from some problematic "
"circumstance (by killing off tasks) until a recovery point."

msgid "Other choices include:"
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:58
msgid ""
"`throw!` or `unwind!`. These options reasonably describe the current "
"behavior of task failure, but \"throw\" suggests general exception handling, "
"and both place the emphasis on the mechanism rather than the policy. We also "
"are considering eventually adding a flag that allows `fail!` to abort the "
"process, which would make these terms misleading."
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:64
msgid "`abort!`. Ambiguous with process abort."
msgstr ""

#: src/0221-panic.md:66
msgid ""
"`die!`. A reasonable choice, but it's not immediately obvious what is being "
"killed."
