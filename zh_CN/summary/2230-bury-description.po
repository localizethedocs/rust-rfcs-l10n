msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/2230-bury-description.md:14
msgid ""
"The `description()` method is a waste of time for implementors and users of "
"the `Error` trait. There's high overlap between description and `Display`, "
"which creates redundant implementation work and confusion about relationship "
"of these two ways of displaying the error."
msgstr ""

#: src/2230-bury-description.md:16
msgid ""
"The `description()` method can't easily return a formatted string with per-"
"instance error description. That's a gotcha for novice users struggling with "
"the borrow checker, and gotcha for users trying to display the error, "
"because the `description()` is going to return a less informative message "
"than the `Display` trait."

msgid ""
"When users start omitting bespoke `description()` implementations, code that "
"still uses this method will start getting default strings instead of human-"
"written description. If this becomes a problem, the `description()` method "
"can also be formally deprecated (with the `#[deprecated]` attribute). "
"However, there's no urgency to remove existing implementations of "
"`description()`, so this RFC does not propose formal deprecation at this "
"time to avoid unnecessary warnings during the transition."
